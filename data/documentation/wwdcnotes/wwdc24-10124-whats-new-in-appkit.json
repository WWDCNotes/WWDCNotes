We’ll briefly go through a history of Swift over the past decade, and show you how the community has grown through workgroups, expanded the package ecosystem, and increased platform support. We’ll introduce you to a new language mode that achieves data-race safety by default, and a language subset that lets you run Swift on highly constrained systems. We’ll also explore some language updates including noncopyable types, typed throws, and improved C++ interoperability.","type":"text"}],"role":"sampleCode","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC24-10136-Whats-new-in-Swift","title":"What’s new in Swift","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10136-whats-new-in-swift","type":"topic","kind":"article"},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10124":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc24\/10124","checksum":null,"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc24\/10124","type":"download"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10134-Whats-new-in-App-Intents":{"role":"sampleCode","abstract":[{"text":"Learn about improvements and refinements to App Intents, and discover how this framework can help you expose your app’s functionality to Siri and all-new features.

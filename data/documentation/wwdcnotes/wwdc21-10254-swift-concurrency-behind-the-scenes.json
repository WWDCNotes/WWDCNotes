Discover how you can efficiently navigate an Instruments trace document, interpret trace data, and record additional profiling data to better understand your specific hang."}],"kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","title":"Analyze hangs with Instruments","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10248-analyze-hangs-with-instruments","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10248-Analyze-hangs-with-Instruments"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21-10134-Explore-structured-concurrency-in-Swift":{"role":"sampleCode","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"When you have code that needs to run at the same time as other code, it’s important to choose the right tool for the job.

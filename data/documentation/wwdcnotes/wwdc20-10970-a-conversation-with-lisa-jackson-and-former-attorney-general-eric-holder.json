The first Black American to hold the position, Holder‚Äôs six-year tenure also makes him one of the longest-serving occupants of the office. Currently a partner in Covington & Burling, he‚Äôs served in government for more than 30 years, including appointments by Presidents Obama, Clinton, and Reagan. Lisa Jackson, Apple‚Äôs vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, will interview the former Attorney General on the topic of race in America.

The first Black American to hold the position, Holder‚Äôs six-year tenure also makes him one of the longest-serving occupants of the office. Currently a partner in Covington & Burling, he‚Äôs served in government for more than 30 years, including appointments by Presidents Obama, Clinton, and Reagan. Lisa Jackson, Apple‚Äôs vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, will interview the former Attorney General on the topic of race in America. This wide-ranging discussion will touch on the fight for equal justice, how technology can empower people to change the world for the better, and ways to help in this moment.","type":"text"}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20"]]},"references":{"WWDC20-Icon.png":{"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC20-Icon.png","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"kind":"symbol","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"title":"WWDC Notes","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","role":"collection","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png"}],"alt":null,"type":"image"},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"link","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn More‚Ä¶"}],"url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"},"WWDC20.jpeg":{"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC20.jpeg","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10970":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2020\/10970","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2020\/10970","checksum":null,"type":"download"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC20":{"role":"collectionGroup","title":"WWDC20","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc20","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 12, Swift 5.3, iOS 14, macOS 11 (Big Sur), tvOS 14, watchOS 7."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"WidgetKit"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit Testing"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC20-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC20.jpeg"}],"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20"}}}

Activity Classifiers can be trained on data from these sensors to bring some magic to your app, such as knowing when someone is running or swinging a bat. Learn how the Create ML app makes it easy to train and evaluate one of these Core ML models. Gain a deeper understanding of how to collect the raw data needed for training.

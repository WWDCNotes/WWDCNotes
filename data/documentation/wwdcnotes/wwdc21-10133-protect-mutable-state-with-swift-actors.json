And we‚Äôll take you through the process of enabling additional asynchronous flows in your custom views.","type":"text"}],"role":"sampleCode","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10019-Discover-concurrency-in-SwiftUI","type":"topic"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21-10254-Swift-concurrency-Behind-the-scenes":{"role":"sampleCode","kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10254-swift-concurrency-behind-the-scenes","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10254-Swift-concurrency-Behind-the-scenes","type":"topic","title":"Swift concurrency: Behind the scenes","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Dive into the details of Swift concurrency and discover how Swift provides greater safety from data races and thread explosion while simultaneously improving performance.

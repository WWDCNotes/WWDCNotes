BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel.","type":"text"}],"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-276-Whats-new-in-BNNS-Graph"},"kind":"article","schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"references":{"WWDC25.jpg":{"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","alt":null,"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC25":{"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 26, Swift 6.2, iOS\/macOS\/tvOS\/visionOS 26."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"code":"Foundation Models","type":"codeVoice"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"code":"AlarmKit","type":"codeVoice"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"code":"PermissionKit","type":"codeVoice"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","type":"topic","title":"WWDC25","images":[{"identifier":"WWDC25-Icon.png","type":"icon"},{"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","type":"card"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"kind":"symbol","title":"WWDC Notes","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","type":"topic","role":"collection","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10211-Support-realtime-ML-inference-on-the-CPU":{"role":"sampleCode","abstract":[{"text":"Discover how you can use BNNSGraph to accelerate the execution of your machine learning model on the CPU.

{"sections":[],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"The BNNS Graph Builder API now enables developers to write graphs of operations using the familiar Swift language to generate pre- and post-processing routines and small machine-learning models. BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"isActive":true,"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (23 min)","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276","type":"reference"}},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-276-whats-new-in-bnns-graph"]}],"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-276-Whats-new-in-BNNS-Graph","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"level":2,"type":"heading","text":"Overview","anchor":"overview"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"references":{"WWDC25.jpg":{"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","type":"image","alt":null,"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25.jpg"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC25-360-Discover-machine-learning-and-AI-frameworks-on-Apple-platforms":{"abstract":[{"text":"Tour the latest updates to machine learning and AI frameworks available on Apple platforms.

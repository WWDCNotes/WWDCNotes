BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"sampleCodeDownload":{"action":{"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (23 min)","type":"reference","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276","isActive":true},"kind":"sampleDownload"},"references":{"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"text"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"link"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10211-Support-realtime-ML-inference-on-the-CPU":{"kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10211-support-realtime-ml-inference-on-the-cpu","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Discover how you can use BNNSGraph to accelerate the execution of your machine learning model on the CPU.

BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (23 min)","type":"reference"}},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-276-whats-new-in-bnns-graph"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"references":{"WWDCNotes.png":{"alt":null,"type":"image","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDC25.jpg":{"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","alt":null,"type":"image","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25.jpg"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC25":{"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup","images":[{"identifier":"WWDC25-Icon.png","type":"icon"},{"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","type":"card"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 26, Swift 6.2, iOS\/macOS\/tvOS\/visionOS 26."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"Foundation Models"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"AlarmKit"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"PermissionKit"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25","title":"WWDC25","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25","kind":"article"},"WWDC25-Icon.png":{"alt":null,"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-Icon.png"}],"identifier":"WWDC25-Icon.png","type":"image"},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn More‚Ä¶"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC25-360-Discover-machine-learning-and-AI-frameworks-on-Apple-platforms":{"role":"sampleCode","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-360-Discover-machine-learning-and-AI-frameworks-on-Apple-platforms","kind":"article","title":"Discover machine learning & AI frameworks on Apple platforms","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-360-discover-machine-learning-and-ai-frameworks-on-apple-platforms","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Tour the latest updates to machine learning and AI frameworks available on Apple platforms.

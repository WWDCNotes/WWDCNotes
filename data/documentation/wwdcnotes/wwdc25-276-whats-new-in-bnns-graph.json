BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-276-whats-new-in-bnns-graph"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"sections":[],"metadata":{"role":"sampleCode","roleHeading":"WWDC25","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"title":"What‚Äôs new in BNNS Graph"},"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276","isActive":true,"type":"reference","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (23 min)"}},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-276-Whats-new-in-BNNS-Graph","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"WWDC25.jpg":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","type":"image","alt":null},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"kind":"symbol","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"title":"WWDC Notes","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community.","type":"text"}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10211-Support-realtime-ML-inference-on-the-CPU":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10211-support-realtime-ml-inference-on-the-cpu","title":"Support real-time ML inference on the CPU","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC24-10211-Support-realtime-ML-inference-on-the-CPU","type":"topic","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","abstract":[{"text":"Discover how you can use BNNSGraph to accelerate the execution of your machine learning model on the CPU.

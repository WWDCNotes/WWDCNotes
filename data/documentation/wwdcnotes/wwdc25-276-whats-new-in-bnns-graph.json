BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"metadata":{"title":"What‚Äôs new in BNNS Graph","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"roleHeading":"WWDC25","role":"sampleCode"},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-276-Whats-new-in-BNNS-Graph","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"anchor":"overview","type":"heading","level":2,"text":"Overview"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

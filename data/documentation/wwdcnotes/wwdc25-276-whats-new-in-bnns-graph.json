BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (23 min)","type":"reference"}},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"metadata":{"modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"title":"What‚Äôs new in BNNS Graph","roleHeading":"WWDC25","role":"sampleCode"},"primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"level":2,"type":"heading","anchor":"overview","text":"Overview"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel.","type":"text"}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"metadata":{"title":"What‚Äôs new in BNNS Graph","role":"sampleCode","roleHeading":"WWDC25","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}]},"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"type":"reference","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (23 min)","isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276"}},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"kind":"article","references":{"WWDCNotes.png":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"alt":null,"type":"image","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"WWDC25.jpg":{"identifier":"WWDC25.jpg","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null},"WWDC25-Icon.png":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC25-Icon.png","alt":null},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/276":{"type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276","checksum":null,"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/276"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC25-360-Discover-machine-learning-and-AI-frameworks-on-Apple-platforms":{"kind":"article","title":"Discover machine learning & AI frameworks on Apple platforms","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-360-discover-machine-learning-and-ai-frameworks-on-apple-platforms","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Tour the latest updates to machine learning and AI frameworks available on Apple platforms.

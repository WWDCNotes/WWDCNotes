BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel.","type":"text"}],"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"text":"Overview","anchor":"overview","type":"heading","level":2},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

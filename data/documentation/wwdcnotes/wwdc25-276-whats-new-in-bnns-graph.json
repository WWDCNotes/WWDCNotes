{"metadata":{"roleHeading":"WWDC25","role":"sampleCode","title":"What’s new in BNNS Graph","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}]},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"The BNNS Graph Builder API now enables developers to write graphs of operations using the familiar Swift language to generate pre- and post-processing routines and small machine-learning models. BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year’s bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-276-Whats-new-in-BNNS-Graph","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"type":"heading","text":"Overview","anchor":"overview","level":2},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"😱 “No Overview Available!”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

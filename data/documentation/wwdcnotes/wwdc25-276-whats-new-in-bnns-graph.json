BNNS compiles graphs ahead of execution and supports real-time and latency-sensitive use cases such as audio processing. In this session, we revisit last year‚Äôs bit-crusher example and simplify the Swift component by removing the reliance on a separate Python file and instead implement the audio effect entirely in Swift. The BNNS Graph Builder API is also suited to pre-processing image data before passing that data to a machine learning model. The session also includes a demonstration of clipping the transparent pixels from an image with an alpha channel."}],"metadata":{"role":"sampleCode","roleHeading":"WWDC25","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"title":"What‚Äôs new in BNNS Graph"},"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25"]]},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-276-whats-new-in-bnns-graph"]}],"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"level":2,"text":"Overview","type":"heading","anchor":"overview"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

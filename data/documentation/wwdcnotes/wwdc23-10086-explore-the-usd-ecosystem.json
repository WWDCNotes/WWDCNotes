And we’ll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio.","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10080-build-spatial-experiences-with-realitykit","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10080-Build-spatial-experiences-with-RealityKit","type":"topic","title":"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit"},"WWDC23-10086-content9":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content9.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content9"},"WWDC23-10086-content8":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content8","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content8.jpg"}]},"WWDC23-10086-content11":{"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content11","type":"image","alt":"USD and MaterialX","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content11.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/multitudes":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/multitudes","kind":"article","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/multitudes","images":[{"type":"card","identifier":"multitudes.jpeg"},{"type":"icon","identifier":"multitudes.jpeg"}],"role":"sampleCode","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"student at 42Berlin 🐬 | C & C++ | 🍎 Swift(UI) app dev  | speciality coffee ☕️ & cycling 🚴🏻‍♂️"}],"title":"laurent b (33 notes)"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"alt":null,"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"WWDC23-10086-content10":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content10","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content10.jpg"}]},"https://developer.apple.com/forums/tags/wwdc2023-10086":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/tags\/wwdc2023-10086","type":"link","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Search the forums for tag wwdc2023-10086","type":"text"}],"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/tags\/wwdc2023-10086","title":"Search the forums for tag wwdc2023-10086"},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273/":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10273\/","type":"link","title":"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode","type":"text"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10273\/"},"WWDC23-10086-content7":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content7","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content7.jpg"}]},"WWDC23-10086-content2":{"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content2","type":"image","alt":"USD and MaterialX","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content2.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10149":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10149","type":"link","title":"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit -

And we’ll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio."}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10080-build-spatial-experiences-with-realitykit","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10080-Build-spatial-experiences-with-RealityKit"},"WWDC23-10086-intro1":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC23-10086-intro1.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-intro1"},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10167":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10167","title":"Create 3D models for Quick Look spatial experiences - WWDC23","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Create 3D models for Quick Look spatial experiences - WWDC23"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10167"},"WWDC23-10086-content4":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC23-10086-content4.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content4"},"WWDC23-10086-content8":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC23-10086-content8.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content8"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/multitudes":{"abstract":[{"text":"student at 42Berlin 🐬 | 🍎 Swift(UI) app dev  | speciality coffee ☕️ & cycling 🚴🏻‍♂️","type":"text"}],"title":"laurent b (33 notes)","role":"sampleCode","kind":"article","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/multitudes","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/multitudes"},"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29355828?v=4":{"alt":"Profile image of laurent b","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"https:\/\/avatars.githubusercontent.com\/u\/29355828?v=4","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"https:\/\/avatars.githubusercontent.com\/u\/29355828?v=4"},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10149":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10149","title":"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit - WWDC23","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit - WWDC23"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10149"},"WWDC23-10086-content10":{"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC23-10086-content10.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content10"},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273/":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10273\/","title":"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10273\/"},"https://developer.apple.com/forums/tags/wwdc2023-10086":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/tags\/wwdc2023-10086","title":"Search the forums for tag wwdc2023-10086","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Search the forums for tag wwdc2023-10086"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/tags\/wwdc2023-10086"},"https://laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev/":{"url":"https:\/\/laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev\/","title":"Blog","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Blog"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev\/"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23-10202-Explore-materials-in-Reality-Composer-Pro":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10202-explore-materials-in-reality-composer-pro","title":"Explore materials in Reality Composer Pro","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn how Reality Composer Pro can help you alter the appearance of your 3D objects using RealityKit materials.

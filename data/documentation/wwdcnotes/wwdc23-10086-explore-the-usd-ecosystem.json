And we’ll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio."}],"kind":"article"},"WWDC23-10086-content10":{"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content10","alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content10.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDC23-10086-content2":{"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content2.jpg"}],"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content2"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23","role":"collectionGroup","title":"WWDC23","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 15, Swift 5.9, iOS 17, macOS 14 (Sonoma), tvOS 17, visionOS 1, watchOS 10."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"SwiftData"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"Observation"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit"},{"type":"text","text":" views, and more."}],"images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC23-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC23.jpeg"}],"kind":"article"},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273/":{"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10273\/","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10273\/","title":"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode","type":"text"}]},"WWDC23-10086-content8":{"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content8","alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content8.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDC23-10086-content11":{"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content11.jpg"}],"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content11"},"https://x.com/wrmultitudes":{"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/x.com\/wrmultitudes","url":"https:\/\/x.com\/wrmultitudes","title":"X\/Twitter","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"X\/Twitter","type":"text"}]},"https://developer.apple.com/forums/tags/wwdc2023-10086":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/tags\/wwdc2023-10086","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Search the forums for tag wwdc2023-10086"}],"title":"Search the forums for tag wwdc2023-10086","type":"link","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/tags\/wwdc2023-10086"},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10165":{"title":"Meet Reality Composer Pro - WWDC23","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Meet Reality Composer Pro - WWDC23"}],"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10165","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10165"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"type":"image","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","alt":null,"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDC23-10086-content3":{"identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content3","alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content3.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDC23-10086-content4":{"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content4.jpg"}],"alt":"USD and MaterialX","type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content4"},"WWDC23-10086-content9":{"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10086-content9","alt":"USD and MaterialX","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10086-content9.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"multitudes":{"identifier":"multitudes","alt":"Profile image of laurent b","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/multitudes.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"https://laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev/":{"title":"Blog","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Blog"}],"url":"https:\/\/laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev\/","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev\/"},"https://developer.apple.com/forums/create/question?tag1=795030&tag2=724030&tag3=251":{"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/create\/question?tag1=795030&tag2=724030&tag3=251","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/create\/question?tag1=795030&tag2=724030&tag3=251","title":"Have a question?

With MetalFX Upscaling, your application can now render frames at a lower resolution, reducing rendering time, without compromising rendering quality. We’ll also show you how and when to use its two effects: spatial upscaling, which delivers substantial performance gains, and temporal AA and upscaling, which delivers the highest quality rendering.","type":"text"}],"metadata":{"role":"sampleCode","title":"Boost performance with MetalFX Upscaling","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"roleHeading":"WWDC22"},"sections":[],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"type":"reference","isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2022\/10103","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (22 min)"}},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc22-10103-boost-performance-with-metalfx-upscaling"]}],"kind":"article","primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"type":"heading","text":"Overview","level":2,"anchor":"overview"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"😱 “No Overview Available!”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

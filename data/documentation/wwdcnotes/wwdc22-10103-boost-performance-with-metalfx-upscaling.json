With MetalFX Upscaling, your application can now render frames at a lower resolution, reducing rendering time, without compromising rendering quality. We’ll also show you how and when to use its two effects: spatial upscaling, which delivers substantial performance gains, and temporal AA and upscaling, which delivers the highest quality rendering.","type":"text"}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"action":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc22\/10103","type":"reference","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (22 min)","isActive":true},"kind":"sampleDownload"},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC22-10103-Boost-performance-with-MetalFX-Upscaling","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"sections":[],"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC22"]]},"primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"anchor":"overview","level":2,"type":"heading","text":"Overview"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"😱 “No Overview Available!”"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

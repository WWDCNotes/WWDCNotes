We started with an existing English-language Stable Diffusion model, then used some multilingual data to fine-tune it to use the new BERT embeddings as an input layer, taking those as fixed, and also training a simple linear projection layer to convert dimensionalities. The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"discussion":{"content":[{"anchor":"discussion","text":"Discussion","type":"heading","level":2},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Here are some examples of output from the model.

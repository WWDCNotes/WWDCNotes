We started with an existing English-language Stable Diffusion model, then used some multilingual data to fine-tune it to use the new BERT embeddings as an input layer, taking those as fixed, and also training a simple linear projection layer to convert dimensionalities. The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"identifiers":["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10044-Discover-machine-learning-enhancements-in-Create-ML","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20-10657-Make-apps-smarter-with-Natural-Language","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC19-232-Advances-in-Natural-Language-Framework"],"discussion":{"content":[{"type":"heading","level":2,"anchor":"discussion","text":"Discussion"},{"inlineContent":[{"identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3","type":"image"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here are some examples of output from the model.

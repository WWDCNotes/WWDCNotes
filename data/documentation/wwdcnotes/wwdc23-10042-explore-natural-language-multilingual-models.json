The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"title":"Adapting a model","discussion":{"kind":"content","content":[{"anchor":"discussion","text":"Discussion","level":2,"type":"heading"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here are some examples of output from the model.

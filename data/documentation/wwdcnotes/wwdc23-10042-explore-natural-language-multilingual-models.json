The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"anchor":"Adapting-a-model"}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"type":"reference","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (14 min)","isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10042"}},"metadata":{"title":"Explore Natural Language multilingual models","role":"sampleCode","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"roleHeading":"WWDC23"},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10042-explore-natural-language-multilingual-models"]}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"major":0,"patch":0},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10042-Explore-Natural-Language-multilingual-models","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"text":"Learn how to create custom Natural Language models for text classification and word tagging using multilingual, transformer-based embeddings.

We started with an existing English-language Stable Diffusion model, then used some multilingual data to fine-tune it to use the new BERT embeddings as an input layer, taking those as fixed, and also training a simple linear projection layer to convert dimensionalities. The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input."}],"discussion":{"kind":"content","content":[{"level":2,"anchor":"discussion","text":"Discussion","type":"heading"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here are some examples of output from the model.

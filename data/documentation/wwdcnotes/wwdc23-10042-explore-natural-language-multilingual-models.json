The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"title":"Adapting a model","discussion":{"content":[{"anchor":"discussion","level":2,"text":"Discussion","type":"heading"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3","type":"image"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here are some examples of output from the model.

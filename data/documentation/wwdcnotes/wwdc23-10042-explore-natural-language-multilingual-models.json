The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"identifiers":["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10044-Discover-machine-learning-enhancements-in-Create-ML","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20-10657-Make-apps-smarter-with-Natural-Language","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC19-232-Advances-in-Natural-Language-Framework"],"anchor":"Adapting-a-model"}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"action":{"type":"reference","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10042","isActive":true,"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (14 min)"},"kind":"sampleDownload"},"references":{"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3":{"identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"alt":"Advanced Applications","type":"image"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","title":"WWDC Notes","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community.","type":"text"}],"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","kind":"symbol","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}]},"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications5":{"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications5","alt":"Advanced Applications","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications5.jpg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23":{"kind":"article","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 15, Swift 5.9, iOS 17, macOS 14 (Sonoma), tvOS 17, visionOS 1, watchOS 10."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"SwiftData"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"Observation"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit"},{"type":"text","text":" views, and more."}],"title":"WWDC23","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23","role":"collectionGroup","images":[{"identifier":"WWDC23-Icon.png","type":"icon"},{"identifier":"WWDC23.jpeg","type":"card"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23"},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10042":{"checksum":null,"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10042","type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10042"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23-10044-Discover-machine-learning-enhancements-in-Create-ML":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10044-discover-machine-learning-enhancements-in-create-ml","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10044-Discover-machine-learning-enhancements-in-Create-ML","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Find out how Create ML can help you do even more with machine learning models.

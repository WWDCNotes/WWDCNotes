The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"discussion":{"content":[{"type":"heading","anchor":"discussion","level":2,"text":"Discussion"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"identifier":"WWDC23-10042-advancedApplications3","type":"image"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Here are some examples of output from the model.

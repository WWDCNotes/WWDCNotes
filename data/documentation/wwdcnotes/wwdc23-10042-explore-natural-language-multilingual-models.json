The result then is a Stable Diffusion model that takes multilingual input.","type":"text"}],"identifiers":["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10044-Discover-machine-learning-enhancements-in-Create-ML","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20-10657-Make-apps-smarter-with-Natural-Language","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC19-232-Advances-in-Natural-Language-Framework"],"anchor":"Adapting-a-model"}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (14 min)","type":"reference","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10042","isActive":true}},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10042-explore-natural-language-multilingual-models"]}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"major":0,"patch":0},"references":{"WWDC23-Icon.png":{"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC23-Icon.png","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDC23.jpeg":{"alt":null,"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC23.jpeg"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC19-232-Advances-in-Natural-Language-Framework":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc19-232-advances-in-natural-language-framework","type":"topic","role":"sampleCode","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Natural Language is a framework designed to provide high-performance, on-device APIs for natural language processing tasks across all Apple platforms.

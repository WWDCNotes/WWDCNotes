We’ll also take you through how Shortcuts fits in with existing Mac automation technologies like Automator and AppleScript.","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10232-Meet-Shortcuts-for-macOS","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10232-meet-shortcuts-for-macos","type":"topic","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode"},"https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/blob/108ac4fa4ef7f2622b97a1f5dd92a3e0c6857c60/Documentation/OrderedDictionary.md":{"title":"OrderedSet<Element: Hashable>","titleInlineContent":[{"code":"OrderedSet<Element: Hashable>","type":"codeVoice"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-collections\/blob\/108ac4fa4ef7f2622b97a1f5dd92a3e0c6857c60\/Documentation\/OrderedDictionary.md","type":"link","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-collections\/blob\/108ac4fa4ef7f2622b97a1f5dd92a3e0c6857c60\/Documentation\/OrderedDictionary.md"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"image","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png"}],"alt":null},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"role":"collection","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"type":"topic","title":"WWDC Notes"},"https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms/blob/195e0316d7ba71e134d0f6c677f64b4db6160c46/Guides/Windows.md":{"title":"windows(ofCount:)","titleInlineContent":[{"code":"windows(ofCount:)","type":"codeVoice"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-algorithms\/blob\/195e0316d7ba71e134d0f6c677f64b4db6160c46\/Guides\/Windows.md","type":"link","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-algorithms\/blob\/195e0316d7ba71e134d0f6c677f64b4db6160c46\/Guides\/Windows.md"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21-10061-Meet-TextKit-2":{"title":"Meet TextKit 2","abstract":[{"text":"Meet TextKit 2: Apple’s next-generation text engine, redesigned for improved correctness, safety, and performance.

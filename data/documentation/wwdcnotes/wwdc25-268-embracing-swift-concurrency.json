Concurrency helps you improve app responsiveness and performance, and Swift is designed to make asynchronous and concurrent code easier to write correctly. We‚Äôll cover the steps you need to take an app through from single-threaded to concurrent. We‚Äôll also help you determine how and when to make the best use of Swift concurrency features ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs making your code more asynchronous, moving it to the background, or sharing data across concurrent tasks.","type":"text"}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (28 min)","isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/268","type":"reference"}},"metadata":{"roleHeading":"WWDC25","title":"Embracing Swift concurrency","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"role":"sampleCode"},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc25-268-embracing-swift-concurrency"]}],"kind":"article","identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC25-268-Embracing-Swift-concurrency"},"sections":[],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"type":"heading","text":"Overview","anchor":"overview","level":2},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

And we’ll take you through the process of enabling additional asynchronous flows in your custom views.","type":"text"}],"role":"sampleCode","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10019-discover-concurrency-in-swiftui","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10019-Discover-concurrency-in-SwiftUI","kind":"article","title":"Discover concurrency in SwiftUI","type":"topic"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21-10291-Explore-the-catalog-with-the-Apple-Music-API":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10291-Explore-the-catalog-with-the-Apple-Music-API","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10291-explore-the-catalog-with-the-apple-music-api","title":"Explore the catalog with the Apple Music API","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"Discover how you can use the Apple Music API to fetch music catalog metadata for your app. Explore the latest updates to the API as well as some advanced techniques for shaping your requests and highlighting the right metadata for a project.","type":"text"}]},"https://wwdcnotes.github.io/WWDCNotes/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Contributions are welcome!"}],"title":"Contributions are welcome!","type":"link","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"}}}

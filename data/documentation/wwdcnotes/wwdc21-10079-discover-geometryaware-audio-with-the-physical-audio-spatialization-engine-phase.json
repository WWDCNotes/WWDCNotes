Meet PHASE, Apple’s spatial audio API, and learn how the Physical Audio Spatialization Engine (PHASE) keeps the sound aligned with your experience at all times — helping you create spatial soundscapes and scenes during the development process, rather than waiting until post production. We’ll take you through an overview of the API and its classes, including Sources, Listeners, Acoustic Geometry, and Materials, and introduce the concept of Spatial Modeling. We’ll also show you how to quickly combine PHASE’s basic building blocks to start building an integrated audio experience for your app or game.","type":"text"}],"metadata":{"role":"sampleCode","title":"Discover geometry-aware audio with the Physical Audio Spatialization Engine (PHASE)","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"roleHeading":"WWDC21"},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10079-discover-geometryaware-audio-with-the-physical-audio-spatialization-engine-phase"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"sections":[],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"anchor":"overview","level":2,"text":"Overview","type":"heading"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"😱 “No Overview Available!”"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

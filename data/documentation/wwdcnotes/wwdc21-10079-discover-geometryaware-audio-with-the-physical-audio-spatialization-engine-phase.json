{"abstract":[{"text":"Explore how geometry-aware audio can help you build complex, interactive, and immersive audio scenes for your apps and games. Meet PHASE, Apple‚Äôs spatial audio API, and learn how the Physical Audio Spatialization Engine (PHASE) keeps the sound aligned with your experience at all times ‚Äî helping you create spatial soundscapes and scenes during the development process, rather than waiting until post production. We‚Äôll take you through an overview of the API and its classes, including Sources, Listeners, Acoustic Geometry, and Materials, and introduce the concept of Spatial Modeling. We‚Äôll also show you how to quickly combine PHASE‚Äôs basic building blocks to start building an integrated audio experience for your app or game.","type":"text"}],"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"anchor":"overview","type":"heading","level":2,"text":"Overview"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

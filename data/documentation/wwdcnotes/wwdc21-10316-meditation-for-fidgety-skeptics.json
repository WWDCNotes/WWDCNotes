After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier.","type":"text"}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10316-Meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"WWDCNotes.png":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","title":"WWDC Notes","role":"collection"},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10316":{"checksum":null,"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316"},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"abstract":[{"text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8.","type":"text"},{"text":" ","type":"text"},{"text":"New APIs: ","type":"text"},{"code":"MusicKit","type":"codeVoice"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"DocC"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit 2"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","title":"WWDC21"},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"text"}],"url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"}}}

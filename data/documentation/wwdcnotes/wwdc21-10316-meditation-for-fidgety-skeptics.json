After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier.","type":"text"}],"references":{"WWDCNotes.png":{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"image","alt":null,"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"kind":"symbol","role":"collection","title":"WWDC Notes","type":"topic","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes"},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","kind":"article","type":"topic","title":"WWDC21","abstract":[{"text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8.","type":"text"},{"text":" ","type":"text"},{"text":"New APIs: ","type":"text"},{"code":"MusicKit","type":"codeVoice"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"code":"DocC","type":"codeVoice"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"code":"StoreKit 2","type":"codeVoice"},{"text":", and more.","type":"text"}],"role":"collectionGroup","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"}]},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png","type":"image","alt":null,"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-Icon.png"}]},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"link","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn More‚Ä¶"}]},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10316":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2021\/10316","type":"download","checksum":null,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2021\/10316"}}}

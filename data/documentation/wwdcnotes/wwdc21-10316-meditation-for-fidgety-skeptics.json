{"abstract":[{"text":"Dan Harris is an Emmy Award-winning journalist and the co-anchor of ABC‚Äôs weekend editions of Good Morning America. After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier.","type":"text"}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21"]]},"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"text":"Overview","type":"heading","level":2,"anchor":"overview"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier."}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"major":0,"patch":0},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10316-meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics"]}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"action":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","type":"reference","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (29 min)","isActive":true},"kind":"sampleDownload"},"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"anchor":"overview","text":"Overview","type":"heading","level":2},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

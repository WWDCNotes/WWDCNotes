He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier.","type":"text"}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10316-meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics"]}],"primaryContentSections":[{"kind":"content","content":[{"text":"Overview","type":"heading","anchor":"overview","level":2},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation.

He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier."}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (29 min)","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2021\/10316","isActive":true,"type":"reference"}},"metadata":{"modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"roleHeading":"WWDC21","role":"sampleCode","title":"Meditation for fidgety skeptics"},"references":{"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"text"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","type":"link","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","title":"WWDC21","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"code":"MusicKit","type":"codeVoice"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"code":"DocC","type":"codeVoice"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"code":"StoreKit 2","type":"codeVoice"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21"},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10316":{"checksum":null,"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2021\/10316","type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2021\/10316"},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg","type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}]},"WWDCNotes.png":{"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes\/WWDCNotes.png"}],"alt":null,"type":"image","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"role":"collection","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community.","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","title":"WWDC Notes","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes"}}}

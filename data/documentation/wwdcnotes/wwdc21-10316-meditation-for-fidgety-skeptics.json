{"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Dan Harris is an Emmy Award-winning journalist and the co-anchor of ABC‚Äôs weekend editions of Good Morning America. After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier."}],"metadata":{"modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"title":"Meditation for fidgety skeptics","role":"sampleCode","roleHeading":"WWDC21"},"sampleCodeDownload":{"action":{"overridingTitle":"Watch Video (29 min)","type":"reference","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","isActive":true},"kind":"sampleDownload"},"kind":"article","schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"primaryContentSections":[{"content":[{"anchor":"overview","level":2,"text":"Overview","type":"heading"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"üò± ‚ÄúNo Overview Available!‚Äù","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Be the hero to change that by watching the video and providing notes!

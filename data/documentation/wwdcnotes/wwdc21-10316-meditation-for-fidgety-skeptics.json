After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier."}],"references":{"WWDCNotes.png":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","role":"collectionGroup","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"}],"kind":"article","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"MusicKit"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"DocC"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit 2"},{"text":", and more.","type":"text"}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","title":"WWDC21"},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn More‚Ä¶"}],"type":"link","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10316":{"type":"download","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","checksum":null,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"title":"WWDC Notes","kind":"symbol","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}],"type":"topic","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community.","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes"}}}

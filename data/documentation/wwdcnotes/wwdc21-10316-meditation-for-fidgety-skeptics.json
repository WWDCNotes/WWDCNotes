After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan’s co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today’s world to become 10% happier.","type":"text"}],"sections":[],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10316-meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10316-Meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics"},"metadata":{"title":"Meditation for fidgety skeptics","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"role":"sampleCode","roleHeading":"WWDC21"},"references":{"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"title":"WWDC Notes","type":"topic","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","role":"collection"},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"alt":null,"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10316":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","checksum":null,"type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316"},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"alt":null,"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More…","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Learn More…","type":"text"}],"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"alt":null,"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","type":"topic","images":[{"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png","type":"icon"},{"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg","type":"card"}],"title":"WWDC21","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","abstract":[{"text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8.","type":"text"},{"text":" ","type":"text"},{"text":"New APIs: ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"MusicKit"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"DocC"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit 2"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"kind":"article"}}}

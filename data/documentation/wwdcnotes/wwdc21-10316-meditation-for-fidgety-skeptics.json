After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation.

He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier."}],"references":{"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"title":"WWDC Notes","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","type":"topic","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","role":"collection","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}]},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10316":{"checksum":null,"type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"kind":"article","title":"WWDC21","abstract":[{"text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8.","type":"text"},{"text":" ","type":"text"},{"text":"New APIs: ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"MusicKit"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"DocC"},{"text":", ","type":"text"},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit 2"},{"text":", and more.","type":"text"}],"images":[{"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png","type":"icon"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","role":"collectionGroup"},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn More‚Ä¶"}]},"WWDCNotes.png":{"alt":null,"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"alt":null,"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"alt":null,"variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"}}}

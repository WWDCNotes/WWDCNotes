After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan’s co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today’s world to become 10% happier."}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"kind":"article","metadata":{"modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"role":"sampleCode","roleHeading":"WWDC21","title":"Meditation for fidgety skeptics"},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10316-Meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10316":{"type":"download","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","checksum":null,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316"},"https://wwdcnotes.github.io/WWDCNotes/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"type":"link","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Learn More…","type":"text"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More…"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup","title":"WWDC21","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"MusicKit"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"DocC"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit 2"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}],"images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png"},{"type":"card","identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg"}],"kind":"article"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"type":"topic","title":"WWDC Notes","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","abstract":[{"text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community.","type":"text"}],"kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","role":"collection"},"WWDC21-Icon.png":{"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21-Icon.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC21-Icon.png","alt":null},"WWDC21.jpeg":{"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDC21.jpeg","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDC21.jpeg","alt":null},"WWDCNotes.png":{"type":"image","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","alt":null}}}

After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation.

He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan‚Äôs co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today‚Äôs world to become 10% happier.","type":"text"}],"metadata":{"roleHeading":"WWDC21","modules":[{"name":"WWDC Notes"}],"title":"Meditation for fidgety skeptics","role":"sampleCode"},"kind":"article","variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10316-meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"references":{"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"abstract":[{"text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community.","type":"text"}],"kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","type":"topic","title":"WWDC Notes","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}],"role":"collection"},"https://wwdcnotes.github.io/WWDCNotes/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn More‚Ä¶"}],"type":"link"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","variants":[{"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png","traits":["1x","light"]}],"alt":null,"type":"image"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21":{"kind":"article","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}],"title":"WWDC21","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Xcode 13, Swift 5.5, iOS 15, macOS 12 (Monterey), tvOS 15, watchOS 8."},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"New APIs: "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"MusicKit"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"DocC"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"codeVoice","code":"StoreKit 2"},{"type":"text","text":", and more."}]},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10316":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","checksum":null,"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10316","type":"download"}}}

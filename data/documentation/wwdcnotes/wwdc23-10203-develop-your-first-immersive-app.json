And we’ll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio."}]},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10080/#:~:text=With%20RealityKit%2C%20you%20can%20augment,offers%20a%20lot%20of%20features.":{"titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Build Spatial Experiences with RealityKit","type":"text"}],"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10080\/#:~:text=With%20RealityKit%2C%20you%20can%20augment,offers%20a%20lot%20of%20features.","type":"link","title":"Build Spatial Experiences with RealityKit","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10080\/#:~:text=With%20RealityKit%2C%20you%20can%20augment,offers%20a%20lot%20of%20features."},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"title":"Contributions are welcome!","titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Contributions are welcome!","type":"text"}],"type":"link","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"type":"image","alt":null,"variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png"}],"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10203":{"checksum":null,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10203","type":"download","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc23\/10203"},"https://github.com/stevenpaulhoward":{"type":"link","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stevenpaulhoward","title":"GitHub","identifier":"https:\/\/github.com\/stevenpaulhoward","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"GitHub"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23-10083-Meet-Reality-Composer-Pro":{"kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","title":"Meet Reality Composer Pro","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Discover how to easily compose, edit, and preview 3D content with Reality Composer Pro.

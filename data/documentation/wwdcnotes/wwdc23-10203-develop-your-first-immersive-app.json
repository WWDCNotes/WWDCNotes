And we’ll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio.","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10080-build-spatial-experiences-with-realitykit","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10080-Build-spatial-experiences-with-RealityKit","type":"topic","title":"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","title":"WWDC Notes","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","role":"collection","kind":"symbol","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}]},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10111/":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10111\/","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10111\/","title":"Go Beyond the Window with SwiftUI","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Go Beyond the Window with SwiftUI"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23-111215-Meet-UIKit-for-spatial-computing":{"title":"Meet UIKit for spatial computing","role":"sampleCode","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-111215-Meet-UIKit-for-spatial-computing","kind":"article","abstract":[{"text":"Learn how to bring your UIKit app to visionOS.

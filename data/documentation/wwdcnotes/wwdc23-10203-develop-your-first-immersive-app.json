And we’ll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio."}],"kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc23-10080-build-spatial-experiences-with-realitykit","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10080-Build-spatial-experiences-with-RealityKit","role":"sampleCode","type":"topic"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"title":"WWDC Notes","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","type":"topic","images":[{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","type":"icon"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","kind":"symbol"},"WWDC23-Icon.png":{"identifier":"WWDC23-Icon.png","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDC23-Icon.png"}],"type":"image","alt":null},"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10111/":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10111\/","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10111\/","type":"link","title":"Go Beyond the Window with SwiftUI","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Go Beyond the Window with SwiftUI"}]},"stevenpaulhoward":{"identifier":"stevenpaulhoward","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/stevenpaulhoward.jpeg"}],"type":"image","alt":"Profile image of stevenpaulhoward"},"WWDCNotes.png":{"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png"}],"type":"image","alt":null},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/stevenpaulhoward":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/stevenpaulhoward","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/stevenpaulhoward","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"3D connoisseur"}],"kind":"article","type":"topic","role":"sampleCode","title":"stevenpaulhoward (4 notes)","images":[{"type":"card","identifier":"stevenpaulhoward.jpeg"},{"type":"icon","identifier":"stevenpaulhoward.jpeg"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC23-10083-Meet-Reality-Composer-Pro":{"type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC23-10083-Meet-Reality-Composer-Pro","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","abstract":[{"text":"Discover how to easily compose, edit, and preview 3D content with Reality Composer Pro.

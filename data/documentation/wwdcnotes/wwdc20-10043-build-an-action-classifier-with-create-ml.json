With a custom action classifier, your app can recognize and understand body movements in real-time from videos or through a camera. We‚Äôll show you how to use samples to easily train a Core ML model to identify human actions like jumping jacks, squats, and dance moves. Learn how this is powered by the Body Pose estimation features of the Vision Framework.

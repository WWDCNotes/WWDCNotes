We’ll also discuss the importance of atomicity in your code, share the nuances of Sendable checking to maintain isolation, and revisit assumptions about ordering work in a concurrent system.","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","title":"Eliminate data races using Swift Concurrency","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC22-110351-Eliminate-data-races-using-Swift-Concurrency","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc22-110351-eliminate-data-races-using-swift-concurrency","role":"sampleCode"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21-10132-Meet-asyncawait-in-Swift":{"type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Swift now supports asynchronous functions — a pattern commonly known as async\/await.

We‚Äôll show you how concurrent workflows interact with your ObservableObjects, and explore how you can use them directly in your SwiftUI views and models. Find out how to use await to make your app run smoothly on the SwiftUI runloop, and learn how to fetch remote images quickly with the AsyncImage API. And we‚Äôll take you through the process of enabling additional asynchronous flows in your custom views.","type":"text"}],"title":"Discover concurrency in SwiftUI","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10019-discover-concurrency-in-swiftui"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC21-10194-Swift-concurrency-Update-a-sample-app":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC21-10194-Swift-concurrency-Update-a-sample-app","title":"Swift concurrency: Update a sample app","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10194-swift-concurrency-update-a-sample-app","role":"sampleCode","kind":"article","abstract":[{"text":"Discover Swift concurrency in action: Follow along as we update an existing sample app. Get real-world experience with async\/await, actors, and continuations.

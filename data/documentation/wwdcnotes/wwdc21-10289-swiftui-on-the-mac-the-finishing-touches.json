The journey continues as we explore how our sample gardening app can adapt to a person‚Äôs preferences and specific workflows. Learn how SwiftUI apps can automatically react to system settings, and discover how you can use that information to add more personality to an app. We‚Äôll show you how you can give people the flexibility to customize an app through Settings, and explore how to use different workflows for manipulating someone‚Äôs data (like drag and drop). To finish, we‚Äôll show you how you can move data to and from an app, incorporating features like Continuity Camera to provide a simple workflow for importing images.","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","sampleCodeDownload":{"action":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10289","overridingTitle":"Watch Video","isActive":true,"type":"reference"},"kind":"sampleDownload"},"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"sections":[],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc21-10289-swiftui-on-the-mac-the-finishing-touches"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"references":{"WWDCNotes.png":{"type":"image","alt":null,"identifier":"WWDCNotes.png","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDCNotes.png"}]},"https://wwdcnotes.github.io/WWDCNotes/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"text"}],"title":"Learn More‚Ä¶","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.github.io\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes":{"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Session notes shared by the community for the community."}],"type":"topic","role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes","title":"WWDC Notes","kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes","images":[{"type":"icon","identifier":"WWDCNotes.png"}]},"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10289":{"checksum":null,"type":"download","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10289","url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10289"}}}

And learn how to track faces in AR on more devices, including the iPad Air (3rd generation), iPad mini (5th generation), and all devices with the A12 Bionic chip or later that have a front-facing camera.","type":"text"}],"references":{"WWDC20-10611-point_cloud_demo_app":{"identifier":"WWDC20-10611-point_cloud_demo_app","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDC20-10611-point_cloud_demo_app.png"}],"alt":null,"type":"image"},"WWDC20-10611-ferry_building_demo":{"identifier":"WWDC20-10611-ferry_building_demo","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDC20-10611-ferry_building_demo.png"}],"alt":null,"type":"image"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC20-10621-Support-performanceintensive-apps-and-games":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20-10621-Support-performanceintensive-apps-and-games","title":"Support performance-intensive apps and games","url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc20-10621-support-performanceintensive-apps-and-games","role":"sampleCode","kind":"article","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"iOS and iPadOS provide powerful capabilities to help developers deliver breakthrough apps and games across all device generations.

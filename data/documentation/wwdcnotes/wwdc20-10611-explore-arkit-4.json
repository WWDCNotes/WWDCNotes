And learn how to track faces in AR on more devices, including the iPad Air (3rd generation), iPad mini (5th generation), and all devices with the A12 Bionic chip or later that have a front-facing camera.","type":"text"}],"sampleCodeDownload":{"kind":"sampleDownload","action":{"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc20\/10611","overridingTitle":"Watch Video (27 min)","isActive":true,"type":"reference"}},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC20-10611-Explore-ARKit-4"},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc20-10611-explore-arkit-4"]}],"references":{"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10611":{"url":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc20\/10611","type":"download","checksum":null,"identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc20\/10611"},"skhillon.jpeg":{"alt":null,"type":"image","identifier":"skhillon.jpeg","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/skhillon.jpeg"}]},"WWDC20-Icon.png":{"alt":null,"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC20-Icon.png","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDC20-Icon.png"}]},"https://wwdcnotes.com/documentation/wwdcnotes/contributing":{"titleInlineContent":[{"text":"Contributions are welcome!","type":"text"}],"url":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/wwdcnotes.com\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/contributing","title":"Contributions are welcome!"},"https://x.com/SarthakKhillon":{"titleInlineContent":[{"text":"X\/Twitter","type":"text"}],"url":"https:\/\/x.com\/SarthakKhillon","type":"link","identifier":"https:\/\/x.com\/SarthakKhillon","title":"X\/Twitter"},"WWDC20-10611-lidar_scanner":{"alt":null,"type":"image","identifier":"WWDC20-10611-lidar_scanner","variants":[{"traits":["1x","light"],"url":"\/images\/WWDC20-10611-lidar_scanner.png"}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC19-603-Introducing-RealityKit-and-Reality-Composer":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc19-603-introducing-realitykit-and-reality-composer","role":"sampleCode","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC19-603-Introducing-RealityKit-and-Reality-Composer","title":"Introducing RealityKit and Reality Composer","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Architected for AR, RealityKit provides developers access to world-class capabilities for rendering, animation, physics, and spatial audio.

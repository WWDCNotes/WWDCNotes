We’ll briefly go through a history of Swift over the past decade, and show you how the community has grown through workgroups, expanded the package ecosystem, and increased platform support. We’ll introduce you to a new language mode that achieves data-race safety by default, and a language subset that lets you run Swift on highly constrained systems. We’ll also explore some language updates including noncopyable types, typed throws, and improved C++ interoperability.","type":"text"}],"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10136-whats-new-in-swift"},"https://github.com/RamitSharma991":{"identifier":"https:\/\/github.com\/RamitSharma991","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"GitHub"}],"title":"GitHub","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/RamitSharma991","type":"link"},"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20319411?v=4":{"variants":[{"url":"https:\/\/avatars.githubusercontent.com\/u\/20319411?v=4","traits":["1x","light"]}],"identifier":"https:\/\/avatars.githubusercontent.com\/u\/20319411?v=4","alt":"Profile image of Ramit Sharma","type":"image"},"https://":{"identifier":"https:\/\/","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Blog"}],"title":"Blog","url":"https:\/\/","type":"link"},"https://x.com/iosDev_ramit":{"identifier":"https:\/\/x.com\/iosDev_ramit","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"X\/Twitter"}],"title":"X\/Twitter","url":"https:\/\/x.com\/iosDev_ramit","type":"link"},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10063-Whats-new-in-App-Store-Connect":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10063-whats-new-in-app-store-connect","title":"What’s new in App Store Connect","abstract":[{"text":"Explore new features for discovery, testing, and marketing.

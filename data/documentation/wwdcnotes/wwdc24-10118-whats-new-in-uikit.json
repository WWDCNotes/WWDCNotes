We’ll also explore some language updates including noncopyable types, typed throws, and improved C++ interoperability."}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10205-Whats-new-in-watchOS-11":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10205-whats-new-in-watchos-11","title":"What’s new in watchOS 11","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC24-10205-Whats-new-in-watchOS-11","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Explore new opportunities on Apple Watch, including bringing Double Tap support to your watchOS app, making your Smart Stack widgets even more relevant and interactive, and displaying your iOS Live Activities in the Smart Stack."}]},"doc://WWDCNotes/documentation/WWDCNotes/WWDC24-10061-Whats-new-in-StoreKit-and-InApp-Purchase":{"url":"\/documentation\/wwdcnotes\/wwdc24-10061-whats-new-in-storekit-and-inapp-purchase","title":"What’s new in StoreKit and In-App Purchase","kind":"article","role":"sampleCode","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/WWDCNotes\/documentation\/WWDCNotes\/WWDC24-10061-Whats-new-in-StoreKit-and-InApp-Purchase","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Learn how to build and deliver even better purchase experiences using the App Store In-App Purchase system.

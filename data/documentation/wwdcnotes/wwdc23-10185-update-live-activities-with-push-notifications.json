That’s why your app needs to send it to your server before it can start sending push updates. Then, whenever you need to update the Live Activity, your server sends the push request using the token to APNs. Finally, APNs will send the payload to the device, and it will wake your widget extension to render the UI."}]}],"type":"aside","style":"note"},{"anchor":"Acitivity-Framework","text":"Acitivity Framework","type":"heading","level":2},{"name":"Note","content":[{"inlineContent":[{"text":"With the ActivityKit framework, you can ","type":"text"},{"isActive":true,"type":"reference","identifier":"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/activitykit\/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities"},{"text":" from an app Lock Screen.

# Compose advanced models with Create ML Components

Take your custom machine learning models to the next level with Create ML Components. We'll show you how to work with temporal data like video or audio and compose models that can count repetitive human actions or provide advanced sound classification. We'll also share best practices on using incremental fitting to speed up model training with new data.

For an introduction to custom machine learning models, watch "Get to know Create ML Components" from WWDC22.

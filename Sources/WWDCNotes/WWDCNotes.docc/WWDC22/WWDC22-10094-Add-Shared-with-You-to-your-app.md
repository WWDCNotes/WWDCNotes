# Add Shared with You to your app

Shared with You helps people easily find content in your app that someone has shared with them in Messages. Learn how you can support Shared with You in your app and continue the messaging experience right with the content. We'll show you how pinning can give implicit Shared with You permission and can elevate content to be automatically shared. We'll also go over how to present Shared with You content in a Shared with You shelf and visually represent shared items with a Shared with You attribution view.

# Create a more responsive media app

Discover how you can use AVFoundation to keep people focused on your media app’s content — not your loading spinner. We’ll show you how to support a responsive and fluid interface in your app, all while you create rich audiovisual compositions, load audiovisual assets, and prepare media thumbnails. Find out how you can perform these tasks on your app’s main thread while I/O processes in parallel, learn how to get top-notch playback performance when loading data from custom storage, and more. 

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching "What's new in AVFoundation” from WWDC21.

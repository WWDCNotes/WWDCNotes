# Support multiple users in tvOS apps

Discover how you can create personalized, individual experiences in your tvOS app. Weâ€™ll show you how you can offer a single checkbox to store profile data, game save states, and more, providing each person with the same level of data separation they'd have on a personal device like iPhone. Weâ€™ll also explore how the new user-independent keychain can help you maintain your existing sign on experience for multiple people in the same household.

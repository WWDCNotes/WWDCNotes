Discover how you can create personalized, individual experiences in your tvOS app. We’ll show you how you can offer a single checkbox to store profile data, game save states, and more, providing each person with the same level of data separation they'd have on a personal device like iPhone. We’ll also explore how the new user-independent keychain can help you maintain your existing sign on experience for multiple people in the same household.

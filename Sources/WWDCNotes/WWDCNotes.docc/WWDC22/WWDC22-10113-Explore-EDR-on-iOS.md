# Explore EDR on iOS

EDR is Apple's High Dynamic Range representation and rendering pipeline. Explore how you can render HDR content using EDR in your app and unleash the dynamic range capabilities of HDR displays on iPhone and iPad. We'll show how you can take advantage of the native EDR APIs on iOS, provide best practices to help you decide when HDR is appropriate, and share tips for tone-mapping and HDR content rendering. We'll also introduce you to Reference Mode and highlight how it provides a reference response to enable color-critical workflows such as color grading, editing, and content review.

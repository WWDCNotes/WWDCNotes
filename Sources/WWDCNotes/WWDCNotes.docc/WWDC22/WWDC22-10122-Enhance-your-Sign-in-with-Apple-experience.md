# Enhance your Sign in with Apple experience

Learn how you can provide safe and fast authentication in your app using Sign in with Apple. We’ll show you how you can upgrade password-based accounts into secure, single-tap login credentials, and explore how you can seamlessly handle changes to user sessions in your app. We’ll also help you take advantage of Sign In with Apple across the web and on other platforms.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend having familiarity with Sign In with Apple and REST API. We’d also recommend having a basic understanding of JavaScript.

# Load resources faster with Metal 3

Discover how you can use fast resource streaming in Metal 3 to quickly load assets. We'll show you how to use an asynchronous set-it-and-forget-it workflow in your app to take advantage of the speed of SSD storage and the throughput of Apple siliconâ€™s unified memory architecture. We'll also explore how you can create separate queues that run parallel to â€” and synchronize with â€” your GPU render and compute work. Finally, we'll share how to designate assets like audio with high-priority queues to help you load data with lower latency.

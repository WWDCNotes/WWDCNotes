# Transform your geometry with Metal mesh shaders

Meet Metal mesh shaders â€” a modern and flexible pipeline in Metal for GPU-driven geometry creation and processing. We'll explore how this API can improve and add flexibility to your render pipeline, and share some of the opportunities that GPU-driven work can create. Discover how you can create procedural geometry â€” like hair rendering â€” on the GPU using mesh shaders, and build single render passes without additional compute passes or intermediate buffers. We'll also show you how to improve scene processing and rendering through GPU-driven meshlet culling.

# Build your first app in Swift Playgrounds

Learn how you can easily prototype and build apps with Swift Playgrounds. Weâ€™ll show you how to create an app from a blank project, build its interface with SwiftUI, and use Swift Package Manager to add extra functionality from an open source package. We'll also explore how you can debug issues using Previews and the console and take you through submitting an app to App Store Connect for distribution via TestFlight.

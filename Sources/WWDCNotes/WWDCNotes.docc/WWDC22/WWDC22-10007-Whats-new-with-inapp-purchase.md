# What's new with in-app purchase

Learn how you can make your in-app purchase experience even better on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Weâ€™ll take you through enhancements to StoreKit 2 and App Store Server API, and explore improvements to App Store Server Notifications. Discover how you can verify app purchases with App Transaction API, add properties to your StoreKit models, incorporate SwiftUI-friendly APIs and StoreKit Messages, and preserve applicationUsername in transactions. For those working server-side, weâ€™ll show you how to make the most of App Store Server Notifications, additional ways to retrieve user transaction history, and recovery steps when your server experiences an outage.

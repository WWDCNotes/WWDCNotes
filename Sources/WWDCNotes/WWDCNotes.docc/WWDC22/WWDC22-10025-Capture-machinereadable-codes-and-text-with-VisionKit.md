# Capture machine-readable codes and text with VisionKit

Meet the Data Scanner in VisionKit: This framework combines AVCapture and Vision to enable live capture of machine-readable codes and text through a simple Swift API. Weâ€™ll show you how to control the types of content your app can capture by specifying barcode symbologies and language selection. Weâ€™ll also explore how you can enable guidance in your app, customize item highlighting or regions of interest, and handle interactions after your app detects an item.

# Create camera extensions with Core Media IO

Discover how you can use Core Media IO to easily create macOS system extensions for software cameras, hardware cameras, and creative cameras. We'll introduce you to our modern replacement for legacy DAL plug-ins â€” these extensions are secure, fast, and fully-compatible with any app that uses a camera input. We'll take you through the Core Media IO APIs and share how they can support camera manufacturers, video conferencing apps with special effects features, creative app ideas, and more.

Discover how you can use Core Media IO to easily create macOS system extensions for software cameras, hardware cameras, and creative cameras.

We'll take you through the Core Media IO APIs and share how they can support camera manufacturers, video conferencing apps with special effects features, creative app ideas, and more.

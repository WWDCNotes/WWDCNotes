# Maximize your Metal ray tracing performance

Learn how to simplify your ray tracing code and increase performance with the power of Metal 3. Weâ€™ll explore the GPU debugging and profiling tools that can help you tune your ray tracing applications. We'll also show you how you can speed up intersection tests and reduce shader code memory accesses and indirections with per-primitive data in an acceleration structure. And we'll help you implement faster acceleration structure builds and refits to reduce load times and per-frame overhead.

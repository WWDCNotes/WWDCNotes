# Display HDR video in EDR with AVFoundation and Metal

Learn how you can take advantage of AVFoundation and Metal to build an efficient EDR pipeline. Follow along as we demonstrate how you can use AVPlayer to display HDR video as EDR, add playback into an app view, render it with Metal, and use Core Image or custom Metal shaders to add video effects such as keying or color management. Whether you develop games or pro apps, we'll help you decide which frameworks to use and share best practices for selecting transports, colorspaces, and pixelbuffer formats.

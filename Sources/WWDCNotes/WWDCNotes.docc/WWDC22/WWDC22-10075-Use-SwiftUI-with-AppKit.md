# Use SwiftUI with AppKit

Discover how the Shortcuts app uses both SwiftUI and AppKit to create a top-tier experience on macOS. Follow along with the Shortcuts team as we explore how you can host SwiftUI views in AppKit code, handle layout and sizing, participate in the responder chain, enable navigational focus, and more. Weâ€™ll also show you how to host AppKit views, helping you migrate existing code into a SwiftUI layout within your app.

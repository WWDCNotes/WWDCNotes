# What's new with SKAdNetwork

SKAdNetwork helps advertisers measure the success of ad campaigns while maintaining user privacy. We'll explore the latest updates to ad attributions including hierarchical source IDs, hierarchical conversion values, multiple conversions, and SKAdNetwork attributions for web ads. We'll also take you through the importance of crowd anonymity and how you can validate SKAdNetwork impressions through testing in Xcode 13.

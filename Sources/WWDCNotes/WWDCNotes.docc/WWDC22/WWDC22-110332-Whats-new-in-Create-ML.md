# What's new in Create ML

Discover the latest updates to Create ML. We’ll share improvements to Create ML’s evaluation tools that can help you understand how your custom models will perform on real-world data. Learn how you can check model performance on each type of image in your test data and identify problems within individual images to help you troubleshoot mistaken classifications, poorly labeled data, and other errors. We’ll also show you how to test your model with iPhone and iPad in live preview using Continuity Camera, and share how you can take Action Classification even further with the new Repetition Counting capabilities of the Create ML Components framework.

To learn more about all that Create ML can bring to your app, watch "Classify hand poses and actions with Create ML" and "Build dynamic iOS apps with the Create ML framework" from WWDC21.

# Program Metal in C++ with metal-cpp

Your C++ games and apps can now tap into the power of Metal. We'll show you how metal-cpp helps you bridge your C++ code to Metal, explore how each manages object lifecycles, and demonstrate utilities that can help these language cooperate in your app. We'll also share best practices for designing app architecture to elegantly integrate Objective-C and C++ together.

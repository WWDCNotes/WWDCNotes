# Introducing Photo Segmentation Mattes

Photos captured in Portrait Mode on iOS 12 contain an embedded person segmentation matte that made it easy to create creative visual effects like background replacement. iOS 13 leverages on-device machine learning to provide new segmentation mattes for any captured photo. Learn about the new semantic segmentation mattes available to you from both AVCapture and Core Image to isolate a person's hair, skin, and teeth. Using any of these individual mattes or combining all of them, your app can now offer a tremendous amount of photo editing control.

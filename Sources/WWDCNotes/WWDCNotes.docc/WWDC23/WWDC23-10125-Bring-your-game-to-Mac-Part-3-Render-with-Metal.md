# Bring your game to Mac, Part 3: Render with Metal

Discover how you can support Metal in your rendering code as we close out our three-part series on bringing your game to Mac. Once youâ€™ve evaluated your existing Windows binary with the game porting toolkit and brought your HLSL shaders over to Metal, learn how you can optimally implement the features that high-end, modern games require. Weâ€™ll show you how to manage GPU resource bindings, residency, and synchronization. Find out how to optimize GPU commands submission, render rich visuals with MetalFX Upscaling, and more.

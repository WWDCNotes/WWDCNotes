# Go beyond the window with SwiftUI

Get ready to launch into space â€” a new SwiftUI scene type that can help you make great immersive experiences for visionOS. Weâ€™ll show you how to create a new scene with ImmersiveSpace, place 3D content, and integrate RealityView. Explore how you can use the immersionStyle scene modifier to increase the level of immersion in an app and learn best practices for managing spaces, adding virtual hands with ARKit, adding support for SharePlay, and building an "out of this world" experience!

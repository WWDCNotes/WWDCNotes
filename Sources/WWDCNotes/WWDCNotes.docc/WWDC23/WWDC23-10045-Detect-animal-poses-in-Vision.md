# Detect animal poses in Vision

Go beyond detecting cats and dogs in images. Weâ€™ll show you how to use Vision to detect the individual joints and poses of these animals as well â€” all in real time â€” and share how you can enable exciting features like animal tracking for a camera app, creative embellishment on an animal photo, and more. Weâ€™ll also explore other important enhancements to Vision and share best practices.

# Bring your game to Mac, Part 2: Compile your shaders

Discover how the Metal shader converter streamlines the process of bringing your HLSL shaders to Metal as we continue our three-part series on bringing your game to Mac. Find out how to build a fast, end-to-end shader pipeline from DXIL that supports all shader stages and allows you to leverage the advanced features of Apple GPUs. We’ll also show you how to reduce app launch time and stutters by generating GPU binaries with the offline compiler.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching “Bring your game to Mac, Part 1: Make a game plan." And once you’re ready to level up, check out “Bring your game to Mac, Part 2: Render with Metal" from WWDC23.

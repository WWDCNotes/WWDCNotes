# Bring your game to Mac, Part 2: Compile your shaders

Discover how the Metal shader converter streamlines the process of bringing your HLSL shaders to Metal as we continue our three-part series on bringing your game to Mac. Find out how to build a fast, end-to-end shader pipeline from DXIL that supports all shader stages and allows you to leverage the advanced features of Apple GPUs. Weâ€™ll also show you how to reduce app launch time and stutters by generating GPU binaries with the offline compiler.

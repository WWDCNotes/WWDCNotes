# Explore Natural Language multilingual models

Learn how to create custom Natural Language models for text classification and word tagging using multilingual, transformer-based embeddings. We’ll show you how to train with less data and support up to 27 different languages across three scripts. Find out how to use these embeddings to fine-tune complex models trained in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

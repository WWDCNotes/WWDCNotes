# Integrate with motorized iPhone stands using DockKit

Discover how you can create incredible photo and video experiences in your camera app when integrating with DockKit-compatible motorized stands. Weâ€™ll show how your app can automatically track subjects in live video across a 360-degree field of view, take direct control of the stand to customize framing, directly control the motors, and provide your own inference model for tracking other objects. Finally, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to create a sense of emotion through dynamic device animations.

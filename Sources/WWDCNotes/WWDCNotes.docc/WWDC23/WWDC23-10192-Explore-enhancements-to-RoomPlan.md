# Explore enhancements to RoomPlan

Join us for an exciting update to RoomPlan as we explore MultiRoom support and enhancements to room representations. Learn how you can scan areas with more detail, capture multiple rooms, and merge individual scans into one larger structure. Weâ€™ll also share workflows and best practices when working with RoomPlan results that you want to combine into your existing 3D model library.

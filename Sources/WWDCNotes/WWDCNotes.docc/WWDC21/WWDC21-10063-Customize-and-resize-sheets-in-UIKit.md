# Customize and resize sheets in UIKit

Discover how you can create a layered and customized sheet experience in UIKit. We’ll explore how you can build a non-modal experience in your app to allow interaction with content both in a sheet and behind the sheet at the same time. We’ll also take you through sheet size customization, revealing or hiding grabber controls, and adapting between popovers and customized sheets in your app.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend watching the Presentations portion of “Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13” from WWDC19 beginning at 9:45.

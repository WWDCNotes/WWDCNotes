# Build interfaces with style

Discover how you can iterate upon your interfaces even more quickly when building your apps. Learn how you can modernize your UI with the latest button styles and table view cell content configurations, both of which give you greater control directly inside of Interface Builder. Weâ€™ll show you how you can preview common customizations with accessibility overrides â€” such as dynamic type size and increased contrast â€” all without leaving the canvas. Weâ€™ll also take you through hierarchical symbols to easily add a splash of color to reinvigorate your app. Whether youâ€™re just starting out or have been developing apps for years, learn best practices for creating great interfaces with tips and tricks sprinkled along the way.

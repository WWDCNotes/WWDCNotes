# Capture and process ProRAW images

When you support ProRAW in your app, you can help photographers easily capture and edit images by combining standard RAW information with Appleâ€™s advanced computational photography techniques. Weâ€™ll take you through an overview of the format, including the look and feel of ProRAW images, quality metrics, and compatibility with your app. From there, weâ€™ll explore how you can incorporate ProRAW into your app at every stage of the production pipeline, including capturing imagery with AVFoundation, storage using PhotoKit, and editing with Core Image.

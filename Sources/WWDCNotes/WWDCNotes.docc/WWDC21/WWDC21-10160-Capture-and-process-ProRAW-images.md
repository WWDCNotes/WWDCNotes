# Capture and process ProRAW images

When you support ProRAW in your app, you can help photographers easily capture and edit images by combining standard RAW information with Apple’s advanced computational photography techniques. We’ll take you through an overview of the format, including the look and feel of ProRAW images, quality metrics, and compatibility with your app. From there, we’ll explore how you can incorporate ProRAW into your app at every stage of the production pipeline, including capturing imagery with AVFoundation, storage using PhotoKit, and editing with Core Image.

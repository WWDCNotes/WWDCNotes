# Explore Xcode Cloud workflows

Learn how Xcode Cloud workflows can help you and your team automate building, analyzing, testing, archiving, and distributing your apps and frameworks. They are flexible, extensible, and can be configured around your team’s development and distribution process. Find out the basics of Xcode Cloud Workflows, discover how to configure them from end to end, and check out recommended workflows to get you started with Apple’s continuous integration system.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching “Meet Xcode Cloud” from WWDC21.

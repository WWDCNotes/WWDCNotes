# Discover built-in sound classification in SoundAnalysis

Explore how you can use the Sound Analysis framework in your app to detect and classify discrete sounds from any audio source â€” including live sounds from a microphone or from a video or audio file â€” and identify precisely in a moment where that sound occurs. Learn how the built-in sound classifier makes it easy for you to identify over 300 different types of sounds without the need for a custom trained model. This includes a variety of noises, ranging from human sounds, musical instruments, animals, and various items.

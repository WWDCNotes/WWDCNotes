# Discover geometry-aware audio with the Physical Audio Spatialization Engine (PHASE)

Explore how geometry-aware audio can help you build complex, interactive, and immersive audio scenes for your apps and games. Meet PHASE, Appleâ€™s spatial audio API, and learn how the Physical Audio Spatialization Engine (PHASE) keeps the sound aligned with your experience at all times â€” helping you create spatial soundscapes and scenes during the development process, rather than waiting until post production. Weâ€™ll take you through an overview of the API and its classes, including Sources, Listeners, Acoustic Geometry, and Materials, and introduce the concept of Spatial Modeling. Weâ€™ll also show you how to quickly combine PHASEâ€™s basic building blocks to start building an integrated audio experience for your app or game.

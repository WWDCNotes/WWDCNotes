# Measure health with motion

Discover how you can take your appâ€™s health monitoring to the next level with motion data. Meet Walking Steadiness for iPhone and the six-minute-walk metric for Apple Watch: Walking Steadiness can help your app interpret someoneâ€™s quality of walking and risk of falling, while the six-minute-walk metric â€” along with the HealthKit estimate recalibration API â€” can track changes to walking endurance following acute events like surgery. Weâ€™ll show you how you can support these metrics and help provide actionable health data to people who use your app, helping improve patient care and clinical trials, especially as more services must be delivered remotely.

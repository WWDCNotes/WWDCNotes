# Use the camera for keyboard input in your app

Learn how you can support Live Text and intelligently pull information from the camera to fill out forms and text fields in your app. Weâ€™ll show you how to apply content filtering to capture the correct information when someone uses the camera as keyboard input and apply it to a relevant UITextField, helping your app input data like phone numbers, addresses, and flight information. And weâ€™ll explore how you can create a custom interface, extend other controls like UIImageViews to support this capability, and more.

# Meditation for fidgety skeptics

Dan Harris is an Emmy Award-winning journalist and the co-anchor of ABC's weekend editions of Good Morning America. After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan's co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today's world to become 10% happier.

# Diagnose Power and Performance regressions in your app

Quickly discover how to identify priorities when viewing power and performance regressions. Learn how to track metrics that have regressed with device-and percentile-specific information, so you can focus your efforts on optimization and save valuable development time. We’ll also show you how to track down common anti-patterns in your app that wear out device storage, help you customize your workflows, and add App Store Connect APIs to help you stay up to date on your app’s real-world performance.

# Diagnose Power and Performance regressions in your app

Quickly discover how to identify priorities when viewing power and performance regressions. Learn how to track metrics that have regressed with device-and percentile-specific information, so you can focus your efforts on optimization and save valuable development time. Weâ€™ll also show you how to track down common anti-patterns in your app that wear out device storage, help you customize your workflows, and add App Store Connect APIs to help you stay up to date on your appâ€™s real-world performance.

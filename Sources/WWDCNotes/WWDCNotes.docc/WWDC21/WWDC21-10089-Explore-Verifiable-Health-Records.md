# Explore Verifiable Health Records

Find out how you can securely request access to someoneâ€™s verifiable health records and incorporate that data safely into your app. The Health app helps people download, view, and share their health records, including their COVID-19 immunization and test results â€” and iOS 15 brings support for the SMART Health Card, a verifiable health record that incorporates the FHIR health data standard. Weâ€™ll show you how your app can go about requesting access to this record and how you can verify the signature of the file using CryptoKit and the issuerâ€™s public key.

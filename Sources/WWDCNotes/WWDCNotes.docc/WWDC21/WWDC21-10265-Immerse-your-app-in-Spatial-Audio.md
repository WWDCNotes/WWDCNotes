# Immerse your app in Spatial Audio

Discover how spatial audio can help you provide a theater-like experience for media in your apps and on the web. We’ll show you how you can easily bring immersive audio to those listening with compatible hardware, and how to automatically deliver different listening experiences depending on someone’s bandwidth or connection — all with little to no change to your code. And gain recommendations on how you can tailor the experience in your app and use spatial audio to tell stories in new, exciting ways.

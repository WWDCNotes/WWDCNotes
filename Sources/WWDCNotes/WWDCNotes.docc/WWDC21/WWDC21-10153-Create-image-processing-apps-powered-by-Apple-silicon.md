# Create image processing apps powered by Apple silicon

Discover how to optimize your image processing app for Apple silicon. Explore how to take advantage of Metal render command encoders, tile shading, unified memory architecture, and memoryless attachments. Weâ€™ll show you how to use Apple's unique tile based deferred renderer architecture to create power efficient apps with low memory footprint, and take you through best practices when migrating your compute-based apps from discrete GPUs to Apple silicon.

# Get started with Dynamic Type

Dynamic Type lets people choose their preferred text size across the system and all of their apps. To help you get started supporting Dynamic Type, weâ€™ll cover the fundamentals: How it works, how to find issues with scaling text in your app, and how to take practical steps using SwiftUI and UIKit to create a great Dynamic Type experience. Weâ€™ll also show how you can best use the Large Content Viewer to make navigation controls accessible to everyone.

# Bring your Live Activity to Apple Watch

Bring Live Activities into the Smart Stack on Apple Watch with iOS 18 and watchOS 11. We‚Äôll cover how Live Activities are presented on Apple Watch, as well as how you can enhance their presentation for the Smart Stack. We‚Äôll also explore additional considerations to ensure Live Activities on Apple Watch always present up-to-date information.

## Key Takeaways

- ‚åö Live Activities can now be viewed on Apple Watch
- üèùÔ∏è A default Smart Stack view is created for all Live Activities
- üé® Custom view can be created using the `.small` Activity Family
- üåó Live Activities can respond to Always On screen states

## Review your Live Activity
If a Live Activity does not have an Apple Watch component a default layout will be used to show the Live Activity in
the Smart Stack.

### Default Component
- The leading and trailing compact views will be displayed with the title of your app
- Alerting updates will display the alert and then transition back to the live activity
- Tapping the live activity will show a full screen version of the Live Activity with an option to "Open on iPhone"

## Customize for Apple Watch

- The default presentation for an Apple Watch Live Activity is `.compact`
- Use the `.small` activity family to create a custom Live Activity for the Smart Stack

```swift
struct DeliveryLiveActivity: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        ActivityConfiguration(
            for: DeliveryActivityAttributes.self
        ) { context in
            DeliveryActivityContent(context: context)
        } dynamicIsland: { context in ... }
        .supplementalActivityFamilies([.small])     // <-- Support for Smart Stack
    }
}
```

- Use the `activityFamily` environment variable to provide different views for each Live Activity format

```swift
struct DeliveryActivityContent: View {
    @Environment(\.activityFamily) var activityFamily
    var context: ActivityViewContext<DeliveryActivityAttributes>

    var body: some View {
        switch activityFamily {
        case .small:
            DeliverySmallContent(context: context)  // <-- Content for Smart Stack
        case .medium:
            DeliverySmallContent(context: context)  // <-- Content for iOS Lock Screen
        }
    }
}
```

## Keep it Live

### Update Frequency

- Updates between iPhone and Apple Watch are synchronized
- Synchronization is budgeted to protect battery life
- High frequency updates are supported when requested

### Always on Display

- Use the `isLuminanceReduced` environment variable to modify your view for the always on display

```swift
struct DeliveryGauge: View {
    @Environment(\.(isLuminanceReduced) var isLuminanceReduced
    var context: ActivityViewContext<DeliveryActivityAttributes>
    
    var body: some View {
        Gauge(value: context.state.progressPercent) {
            GaugeLabel(context: context)
        }
        .tint(isLuminanceReduced ? .gaugeDim : .gauge)
    }
}
```

- Set the preferred color scheme to light to use light mode
    - Dark mode will still be used for Always on Display with Reduced Luminance

```swift
struct DeliveryActivityContent: View {
    @Environment(\.activityFamily) var activityFamily
    var context: ActivityViewContext<DeliveryActivityAttributes>

    var body: some View {
        switch activityFamily {
            case .small:
                DeliverySmallContent(context: context)
                    .preferredColorScheme(.light)
        }
    }
}
```

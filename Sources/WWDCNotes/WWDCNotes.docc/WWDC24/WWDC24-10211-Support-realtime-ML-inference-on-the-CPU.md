# Support real-time ML inference on the CPU

Discover how you can use BNNSGraph to accelerate the execution of your machine learning model on the CPU. We will show you how to use BNNSGraph to compile and execute a machine learning model on the CPU and share how it provides real-time guarantees such as no runtime memory allocation and single-threaded running for audio or signal processing models.

# Bring context to todayâ€™s weather

Harness the power of WeatherKit to get detailed weather forecast data such as precipitation amounts by type, cloud cover by altitude, or maximum wind speed. Find out how you can summarize weather by different parts of the day and highlight significant upcoming changes to temperature or precipitation. Understand how you can compare current weather to the past through our Historical Comparisons dataset and dive into historical weather statistics for any location in the world. Weâ€™ll also explore how you can do all of this faster with our Swift and REST APIs.

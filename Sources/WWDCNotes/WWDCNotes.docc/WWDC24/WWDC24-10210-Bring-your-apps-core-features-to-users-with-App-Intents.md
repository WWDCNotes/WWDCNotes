## Key Takeaways

Bring your app's core features to users with App Intents

- ðŸ˜‡ Allow your apps to flow and not generate friction
- ðŸ§  Empower user's creativity & flexibility
- ðŸŒŠ Embed your app's features into the system

## Presenters

## Session

This session is broken down into the following sections:

- Friction versus flow
- Understanding the framework
- Building the code

Throught this session an example app is references that allows users to list and interact with their favourite hiking trails.

## Friction versus Flow

- Flow is the melding of thought and action
- when applied to a device: the next thing you need is nearby and easy to get to
- Friction is the distracting extra steps in the way of your flow.

Users don't just use one app to complete a task - they use many - and moving from app to app introduces friction. App Intents allows you to make the system aware of your core features and lift them up and outside of your app to increase flow.

These can include (for example):

- Spotlight Search
- showing app shortcuts action in Spotlight searches.
- Siri
- executing an app shortcut when the user requests it with their voice
- Widgets
- adding a widget to the Home or Lock screen
- Control Center
- adding a custom control to the Control Center

### Who chooses which App Intent is shown?

With features like Spotlight, the developer chooses the actions to show and the system shows them automatically in the right spot.

With features like Widgets and Controls, the user chooses. The developer provides flexible components and the user chooses which ones matter and where they matter.

If you want this kind of interaction: adopt App Intents

## Understanding the framework

App Intents is a common foundation for building features. It takes core features from inside your app, actions, or content that's meaningful and presents them outside your app.

In order to do this, you need to expose actions and content to the App Intents framework which will handle communication with the system in order to execute actions or show content.

There are three top-level concepts:

- Intents - Perform an action
- i.e. opening a view or starting some work
- described in the session as a verb
- Entities - Data
- i.e. a type in your app or some concept relating to your app's data
- described in the session as a noun
- App Shortcuts
- i.e. an intent and entity plus additional options to represent an important function of your app
- described in the session as a sentence, packaging a verb and noun or blank to fill in a noun and whatever other options are needed into a single thing that describes an important function of your app.

With Intents, Entities, and App Shortcuts - you can define how your app appears across the system.

## Building the code

This will cover 5 examples of an App Intent:

- Shortcuts action
- Parameterized action
- Home Screen widget
- Control Center control
- Spotlight and Siri

App Intents will allow you to share a lot of code between these features.

This session uses an example app that allows users to store a collection of their favorite Trails.

### Shortcuts action

Users may want a very specific feature that as a developer you may not want to prioritize, but you can add flexibility in the form of Shortcuts actions so users can build this themselves.

For this example, there's a feature to pin a trail to the top of the trail list in the app, we will make a Shortcuts action to open the pinned trail details in the app.

An intent is a type that confirms to the App Intent protocol. It has two required pieces: a localizable title and a perform method.

```swift
struct OpenPinnedTrail: AppIntent {
	static let title: LocalizedStringResource = "Open Pinned Trail"

	func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
		NavigationModel.shared.navigate(to: .pinned)
		return .result()
	}

	// Tell App Intents to open the app when this Intent is run
	static let openAppWhenRun: Bool = true
}
```

This intent will now show as an action in the Shortcuts app library.

### Parameterized action

For this example, we want to create an Intent that opens a specific, user-defined trail. To do this, we need an Intent with a parameter. This will use code that's very similar to `OpenPinnedTrail`.

> By adopting the `OpenIntent` protocol, `openAppWhenRun` is implied and can be removed.

```swift
struct OpenTrail: AppIntent, OpenIntent {
	static let title: LocalizedStringResource = "Open Trail"

	@Parameter(title: "Trail")
	var target: TrailEntity

	func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
		NavigationModel.shared.navigate(to: target)
		return .result()
	}
}
```

Entities and parameters should be meaningful to a user of the app. An Entity is a type that conforms to the `AppEntity` protocol. You can conform your type to this directly, or you can create a new Entity that refers to another type in your project - this is especially useful when your type might be expensive to create or use.

Entities must have 3 things:

- A display representation
- used by the system to draw the entity in a menu
- A persistent ID
- A query

```swift
struct TrailEntity: AppEntity {
	@Property(title: "Trail Name")
	var name: String

	static let typeDisplayRepresentation: TypeDisplayRepresentation = "Trail"

	var displayRepresentation: DisplayRepresentation {
		DisplayRepresentation(title: name, image: Image(named: imageName))
	}

	var id: Trail.ID

	static var defaultQuery = TrailEntityQuery() 
}
```

#### Queries

A query turns a question asking for entities into actual entities. There are several subprotocol of `EntityQuery` that handle a variety of questions.

This example shows 2 of the query protocols:

```swift
struct TrailEntityQuery: EntityQuery {
	func entities(for identifiers: [TrailEntity.ID]) async throws -> [TrailEntity] { ... }
}

extension TrailEntityQuery: EnumerableEntityQuery {
	func allEntities() async throws -> [TrailEntity] { ... }
}
```

#### Parameter Summaries

Parameter summaries are natural language sentence that describes what the intent will do, including the values of all the essential parameters

This makes the intent easier to use and read:

@Row(numberOfColumns: 2) {
	@Column(size: 1) {
		@Image(source: "app-intent-before-parameter-summary", alt: "The Shortcuts app with an intent open that doesn't use parameter summaries showing the text 'Open Trail' with a disclosure indicator") {
			Without Parameter Summaries
		}
	}
	@Column(size: 1) {
		@Image(source: "app-intent-after-parameter-summary", alt: "The Shortcuts app with an intent open that uses parameter summaries showing the text 'Open Trail' with Trail being a selectable box") {
			With Parameter Summaries
		}
	}
}

Adjusting the previous example, we can add a parameter summary:

```swift
struct OpenTrail: AppIntent, OpenIntent {
	...

	static var parameterSummary: some ParameterSummary {
		Summary("Open \(\.$trail)")
	}
}
```

### Home Screen widget

- Designed for glanceable information
- Optionally configurable

```swift
struct TrailConditionsWidget: Widget {
	static let kind = "TrailConditionsWidget"

	var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
		AppIntentConfiguration(
			kind: Self.kind,
			intent: TrailConditionsConfiguration.self,
			provider: Provider()
		) {
			TrailConditionsEntryView(entry: $0)
		}
	}
}
```

- Create a `AppIntentConfiguration` and pass a configuration intent to the `intent` parameter.
- Configuration Intents conform to `WidgetConfigurationIntent`
- To make it configurable - add a parameter

```swift
struct TrailConditionsConfiguration: WidgetConfigurationIntent {
	static var title: LocalizedStringResource = "Trail Conditions"

	@Parameter(title: "Trail")
	var trail: TrailEntity?
}
```

### Control Center control

This is the basic shape for a configurable button control:

```swift
struct TrailConditionsControl: ControlWidget {
	var body: some ControlWidgetConfiguration {
		AppIntentControlConfiguration(
			kind: Self.kind,
			intent: ...
		) { configuration in
			ControlWidgetButton(action: ...) {
				...
			}
		}
	}
}
```

It still requires an intent to hold the configuration of the button contents and an intent instance to handle button taps.

We can reuse the `OpenTrail` intent from before by conforming it to `ControlConfigurationIntent` and then filling in the `TrailConditionsControl` template above:

```swift
extension OpenTrailConfiguration: ControlConfigurationIntent { }

struct TrailConditionsControl: ControlWidget {
	var body: some ControlWidgetConfiguration {
		AppIntentControlConfiguration(
			kind: Self.kind,
			intent: OpenTrail.self
		) { configuration in
			ControlWidgetButton(action: configuration) {
				Image(systemName: configuration.target.glyph)
				Text(configuration.target.name)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

@Image(source: "app-intent-control-center-control", alt: "iOS 18's new Control Center showing the above TrailConditionControl")

### Spotlight and Siri

To make an app action available to Siri and Spotlight:

- make an App Shortcut
- a wrapper around an intent created by the developer
- system offers it in various features:
- Spotlight
- Action Button
- Apple Pencil Pro

```swift
struct TrailShortcut: AppShortcutsProvider {
	static var appShortcuts: [AppShortcut] {
		AppShortcut(
			intent: OpenPinnedTrail(),
			phrases: [
				"Open my pinned trail in \(.applicationName)",
				"Show my pinned trail in \(.applicationName)"
			],
			shortTitle: "Open Pinned Trail",
			systemImageName: "pin"
		)
	}
}
```

Notice:

- providing an instance of the intent
- could customize it's parameters to provide a specific experience
- phrases are needed to invoke the shortcut from Siri
- they must contain the application name
- a short title and image are for when the shortcut is displayed visually

This is handled automatically by the system at app install - there is no need to register the shortcut, or even open the app for the user to access this shortcut.

This is great, but for Siri - it isn't quite right. It will move the user into the app which requires them to break the flow of what they're currently doing.

Instead, we can make a new intent that will show the content in a snippet and speak it if the user isn't looking at their screen or is using a HomePod or AirPods.

```swift
struct GetPinnedTrails: AppIntent {
	static let title: LocalizedStringResource = "Get Pinned Trail"

	func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult & ProvidesDialog & ShowsSnippetView {
		let pinned = TrailDataManager.shared.pinned
		return .result(
			dialog: "The latest reported condition of \(pinned.name) is \(pinned.currentCondition)",
			view: trailConditionsSnippetView()
		)
	}
}
```

## Wrapping Up

Using App Intents lets you:

- Make your app flow
- Adopt features like Siri, Shortcuts, widgets, and more
- All based on App Intents

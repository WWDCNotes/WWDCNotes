# Meet TabletopKit for visionOS

Build a board game for visionOS from scratch using TabletopKit. Weâ€™ll show you how to set up your game, add powerful rendering using RealityKit, and enable multiplayer using spatial Personas in FaceTime with only a few extra lines of code.

This session is a quick, high-level summary of TabletopKit, with pointers to supporting sessions/frameworks. TabletopKit is a framework for building spatial, multiplayer tabletop experiences for Apple Vision Pro: card game, dice game, complex board game. It handles gestures, common layouts. Integrates with RealityKit, GroupActivities, SharePlay.

Key takeaway: TabletopKit handles the actual game surface, board, equipment, state. Developer manages gameplay. RealityKit, SharePlay, and GroupActivities used to implement the details. For visionOS only.

Components: 
- game table, with seats
- game equipment
- player pawns

Walkthrough of building the game structure:
- `Tabletop` (a RealityKit `Entity`)
- place `Seat`s around the table. 
- everything on the `Tabletop` is `Equipment` (and usually has corresponding RealityKit `Entity`).

Player pawn has physical rep and a pose. Is owned by its seat.

State is tracked by `BaseEquipmentState`, `TableVisualState`. 

Actions can be automated (like dealing cards) or interactive (rolling a die, drawing/placing a card). Uses system interaction gestures. Gestures are tracked through their phases by `TabletopInteraction` objects. Discrete `actions` modify game state. Callback for gesture begin, end, cancel.

TabletopKit provides info about what was moved. Developer is responsible for enforcing rules.

Visual sugar: RealityKit pawn animations, other RK special effects (like sound). 

Multiplayer: spatial personas, Facetime, SharePlay, optional custom spatial Persona templates for multiplayer layout.

GroupActivities and SharePlay handle state sync.

# A Swift Tour: Explore Swiftâ€™s features and design

Learn the essential features and design philosophy of the Swift programming language. Weâ€™ll explore how to model data, handle errors, use protocols, write concurrent code, and more while building up a Swift package that has a library, an HTTP server, and a command line client. Whether youâ€™re just beginning your Swift journey or have been with us from the start, this talk will help you get the most out of the language.

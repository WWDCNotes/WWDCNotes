# A Swift Tour: Explore Swift’s features and design

Learn the essential features and design philosophy of the Swift programming language. We'll explore how to model data, handle errors, use protocols, write concurrent code, and more while building up a Swift package that has a library, an HTTP server, and a command line client. Whether you’re just beginning your Swift journey or have been with us from the start, this talk will help you get the most out of the language.

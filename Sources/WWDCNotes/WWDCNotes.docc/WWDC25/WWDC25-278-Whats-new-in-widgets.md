# Whatâ€™s new in widgets

WidgetKit elevates your app with updates to widgets, Live Activities, and controls. Learn how to bring your widgets to visionOS, take them on the road with CarPlay, and make them look their best with accented rendering modes. Plus, find out how relevant widgets can be surfaced in the Smart Stack on watchOS, and discover how push notifications can be used to keep your widgets up to date.

## Key Takeaways
- ðŸ˜Ž Widgets get new looks
- ðŸš— New places for Widgets: visionOS, CarPlay, macOS, Controls
- ðŸŽ¯ Reload(or surface) widgets by relevance
- ðŸ“¬ Keep widgets up to date by push notifications

## New Look for Widgets

### Generate Process
Widgets content is generated using accented rendering mode. The new presentations are constructed similarly across iOS and macOS:
1. Tinting all of the content to white
2. Widgets background is removed
3. A themed glass or tinted color effect is added as the new background

### Updates for better handling accented rendering
- Observe `.widgetRenderingMode` environment variable
- Stay with the origin design if rendering mode is `.fullColor`
- Play with the `.widgetAccentedRenderingMode` modifier of Images if rendering mode is `.accented`, such as setting it to `.desaturated`

### More on .widgetAccentedRenderingMode
There are five options `.widgetAccentedRenderingMode` accepts. Depending on the different default accent color on iOS and watchOS, the results of setting these options may differ.
@TabNavigator {
   @Tab("nil") {
      @Image(source: "WWDC25-278-nil-mode")
   }
   @Tab(".accented") {
      @Image(source: "WWDC25-278-Accented-mode")
   }
   @Tab(".desaturated") {
      @Image(source: "WWDC25-278-Desaturated-mode")
   }
   @Tab(".accentedDesaturated") {
      @Image(source: "WWDC25-278-AccentedDesaturated-mode")
   }
   @Tab(".fullColor") {
      @Image(source: "WWDC25-278-FullColor-mode")
   }
}
Note that for better blend in with the watch face, option `.fullColor` is ignored on watchOS.

For most widgets, use either `.desaturated` or `.accentedDesaturated` to help the Image content blend in with the rest of the home screen.
Use `.fullColor` for Images that represent media content, such as album artwork or a book cover.

## Widgets in new places

### visionOS
Compatible iPhone or iPad app with widgets will automatically become available in visionOS.
- `.supportedMountingStyles`: defaults to `.elevated` on visionOS
- `.widgetTexture`: defaults to `.glass`
- A new widget family: `.systemExtraLargeProtrait`
- Same approach as iOS and macOS for accented rendering
- `.levelOfDetail` environment variable. If widgets are physically far enough away, it will changed to `.simplified`.

### CarPlay
In iOS 26, widgets are available in all CarPlay cars.

#### CarPlay widget design
- Glanceable information
- Large typography
- Legibility

#### Widgets in CarPlay
- StandBy presentation
- Supports touchscreen interaction
- Test with CarPlay Simulator

#### Live Activities in CarPlay
- Using `.supplementalActivityFamilies([.small])` to indicates that the Live Activity supports CarPlay
- This will also improve the look of Live Activity presented on a paired Apple Watch

### macOS
Live Activities from a paired iPhone will now appear in macOS Tahoe. When it is selected, the lock screen presentation from iPhone will appear.
Clicking the lock screen presentation will launch the associated app using iPhone Mirroring.

#### Live Activities on macOS
- iOS 18 and later
- No code changes
- Interaction and deep link

### Controls

#### Controls on macOS
Can be provided from:
- macOS
- Catalyst
- iOS apps on Apple silicon

Can be placed:
- In the Control Center
- On the menu bar

#### Controls on watchOS
Can be provided from:
- watchOS app
- iPhone app on a paired device

Can appear in:
- Control Center
- Executed when pressing the Action button on Apple Watch Ultra
- Smart Stack

## Relevance widgets
Define relevance widget with RelevanceConfiguration:
```swift
struct HappyHourRelevanceWidget: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        RelevanceConfiguration(
            kind: "HappyHour",
            provider: Provider()
        ) { entry in
            WidgetView(entry: entry)
        }
    }
}
```

Implement RelevanceEntriesProvider(similar to TimelineEntriesProvider):
```swift
struct Provider: RelevanceEntriesProvider {
    func placeholder(context: Context) -> Entry {
        Entry()
    }
    
    func relevance() async -> WidgetRelevance<Configuration> {
        let configs = await fetchConfigs()
        var attributes: [WidgetRelevanceAttribute<Configuration>] = []
        
        // Since this widget is time relevant,
        // It should define the relevance attribute using the date interval for each config
        for config in configs {
            attributes.append(WidgetRelevanceAttribute(
                configuration: config,
                context: .date(interval: config.interval, kind: .default)))
        }
        
        return WidgetRelevance(attributes)
    }
    
    // Unlike a Timeline widget, RelevanceEntriesProvider only provides a single entry for a configuration.
    func entry(configuration: Configuration,
               context: RelevanceEntriesProviderContext) async throws -> Entry {
        Entry(shop: configuration.shop, timeRange: configuration.timeRange)
    }
}
```

### Relevnace widgets on watchOS 26
- Connect content with relevance
- Great on their own or alongside timeline widgets

## Widget push updates
- Available on all widget platforms
- Push updates all push-enabled widgets
- Limit update pushes
- Use WidgetKit developer mode

### Widgets reload options
#### Scheduled widget reloads - TimelineReloadPolicy
When a widget is configured on deivce, these things will happen:
1. WidgetKit will request a timeline from the widget extension
2. The extension will respond with a widget timeline, which includes a TimelineReloadPolicy
3. WidgetKit use the timeline to determine the next appropriate time to reload that widget
> Scheduled timeline reload is budgeted by the system to help maintain performance and battery life

#### Explicit widget reloads - calling reloadAllTimelines()
1. Inside the app, `reloadingAllTimelines()` is called
2. WidgetKit then request a timeline from the widget extension to update the widget
> Since the app is running when the API is called, the system does not budget this request

#### Widget push update
1. A server tracking data changes can send a push notification to APNs
2. APNs tells WidgetKit to reload that app's widget
3. Like other updates, WidgetKit will request a updated timeline from the widget extension

### Adding push notification support
1. Create a structure conform to `WidgetPushHandler` protocol
2. Add the Push Notification entitlement to the widget extension
3. Send a widget udpate push request

To update your widget with a push notification, send a HTTPS POST request to the Apple Push Server
```
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:path = /3/device/<DEVICE_TOKEN> // token provided in WidgetPushHandler

// Headers
host = api.sandbox.push.apple.com
apns-push-type = widgets
apns-topic = com.example.CaffeineTracker.push-type.widgets // app's bundle ID suffix with .push-type.widgets

// Body
{
    "aps": {
        "content-changed": true
    }
}
```
Push updates for widgets help keep widgets content more up to date, but are performed opportunistically.

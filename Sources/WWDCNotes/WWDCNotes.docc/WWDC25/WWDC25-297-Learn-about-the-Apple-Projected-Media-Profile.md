# Learn about the Apple Projected Media Profile

Dive into the Apple Projected Media Profile (APMP) and see how APMP enables 180Âº/360Âº and Wide FoV projections in QuickTime and MP4 files using Video Extended Usage signaling. Weâ€™ll provide guidance on using OS-provided frameworks and tools to convert, read/write, edit, and encode media containing APMP. And weâ€™ll review Apple Positional Audio Codecâ€™s (APAC) capabilities for creating and delivering spatial audio content for the most immersive experiences.

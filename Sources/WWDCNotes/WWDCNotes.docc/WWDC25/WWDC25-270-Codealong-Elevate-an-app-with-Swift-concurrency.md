# Code-along: Elevate an app with Swift concurrency

Learn how to optimize your appâ€™s user experience with Swift concurrency as we update an existing sample app. Weâ€™ll start with a main-actor app, then gradually introduce asynchronous code as we need to. Weâ€™ll use tasks to optimize code running on the main actor, and discover how to parallelize code by offloading work to the background. Weâ€™ll explore what data-race safety provides, and work through interpreting and fixing data-race safety errors. Finally, weâ€™ll show how you can make the most out of structured concurrency in the context of an app.

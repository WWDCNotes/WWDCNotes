## What is Liquid Glass
@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-WhatIsLiquidGlass")
- A new "material" that dynamically bends and shapes light and moves like a light weight liquid
- Designed to be rounded forms that float over content of an app
- Previous materials focused on scattering light, while liquid glass bends light

@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-LiquidGlassInteractivity")
- On interactions, Liquid Glass will flex and energize with light
- Liquid Glass moves with gel-like flexibility in tandem with interactions
- Elements can temporarily lift up into Liquid Glass when interacting with a component.

## Adaptivity
@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-AdaptToSurroundingContent")
- Liquid Glass components respond to the surrounding content
    - As text scrolls underneath, shadows become more prominent to create separation
    - Components can independently switch between light and dark mode
    - Light from colorful content nearby can spill onto its surface

@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-AdaptToSize")
- The size of a Liquid Glass components also effects the appearance
    - Larger elements simulate a thicker more substantial material
    - Shadows and scattering of light also increase with component size

## How to use Liquid Glass 
@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-HowToUse")
- Best used for the navigation layer that floats above the content of an app
- Avoid stacking glass on glass
    - When placing elements on top of Liquid Glass use fills and transparency for visual separation

### Variants
@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-Variants")
- 2 variants of Liquid Glass: Regular and Clear
- Do not mix the variants

#### Regular
- More versatile than clear and will be used more frequently
- Retains all adaptive behaviors previously discussed

#### Clear
- Does not have adaptive behaviors
- Permanently more transparent to allow content underneath to come through
- Only use when the following conditions are met:

        1. Elements are over media-rich content  
        2. Content will not be negatively affected by a dimming layer
        3. Covered content is bold and bright

### Tinting Liquid Glass
@Image(source: "WWDC25-219-Tinting")
- Tinting allows you to apply color to Liquid Glass while staying consistent with the material
- Tints should only be used to bring emphasis to primary elements

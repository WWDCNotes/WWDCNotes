# Deliver age-appropriate experiences in your app

Learn how to deliver age-appropriate experiences in your app with the new Declared Age Range API. Weâ€™ll cover how parents can allow their child to share an age range with an app to ensure a safe experience in a privacy-preserving way. Weâ€™ll also explore how this framework can help you tailor your appâ€™s content and features based on a userâ€™s age, and show you how to implement age gates, understand caching, and respect user privacy while creating safer and more engaging experiences.

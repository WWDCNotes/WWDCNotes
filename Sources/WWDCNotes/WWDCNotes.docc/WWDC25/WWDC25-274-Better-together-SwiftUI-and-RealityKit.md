# Better together: SwiftUI and RealityKit

Discover how to seamlessly blend SwiftUI and RealityKit in visionOS 26. Weâ€™ll explore enhancements to Model3D, including animation and ConfigurationCatalog support, and demonstrate smooth transitions to RealityView. Youâ€™ll learn how to leverage SwiftUI animations to drive RealityKit component changes, implement interactive manipulation, use new SwiftUI components for richer interactions, and observe RealityKit changes from your SwiftUI code. Weâ€™ll also cover how to use unified coordinate conversion for cross-framework coordinate transformations.

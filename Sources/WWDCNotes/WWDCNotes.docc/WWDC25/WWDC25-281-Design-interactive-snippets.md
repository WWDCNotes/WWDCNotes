# Design interactive snippets

Snippets are compact views invoked from App Intents that display information from your app. Now, snippets can allow your app to bring even more capability to Siri, Spotlight, and the Shortcuts app by including buttons and stateful information that offer additional interactivity as part of an intent. In this session, you‚Äôll learn best practices for designing snippets, including guidance on layout, typography, interaction, and intent types.

## Interactive Snippets
- Compact view displayed by App Intents.
- Show updated information and offer quick actions
- Appear anywhere App Intents are supported
- Overlay other content until confirmed, cancelled, or swiped away

## Appearance
- Designed for quick, in-the-moment experiences
- Text in snippets has larger sizes than system defaults
- Avoid including content past 340 points in height
    - If more information is needed, link to the relevant view in your app
- Use a vibrant color background so your snippet stands out from the content beneath

### Confirmations
- Used when an action is required before a result can be shown
- After the required action is taken, show a result snippet to show that the intent has completed

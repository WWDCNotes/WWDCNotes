# Get ahead with quantum-secure cryptography

Learn how to protect your appâ€™s sensitive user data from the emerging threat of quantum computing, and safeguard user privacy. Weâ€™ll explore different quantum attacks, their impact on existing cryptographic protocols, and how to defend against them using quantum-secure cryptography. Youâ€™ll learn how to use quantum-secure TLS to secure network data, and use CryptoKitâ€™s quantum-secure APIs for securing application data.

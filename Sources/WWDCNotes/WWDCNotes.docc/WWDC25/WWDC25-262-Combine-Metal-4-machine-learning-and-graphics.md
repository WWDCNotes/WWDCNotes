# Combine Metal 4 machine learning and graphics

Learn how to seamlessly combine machine learning into your graphics applications using Metal 4. Weâ€™ll introduce the tensor resource and ML encoder for running models on the GPU timeline alongside your rendering and compute work. Discover how shader ML lets you embed neural networks directly within your shaders for advanced effects and performance gains. Weâ€™ll also show new debugging tools for Metal 4 ML workloads in action using an example app.

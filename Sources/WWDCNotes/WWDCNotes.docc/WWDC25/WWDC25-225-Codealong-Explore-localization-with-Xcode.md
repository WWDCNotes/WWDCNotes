# Code-along: Explore localization with Xcode

Learn how to localize your app into additional languages using Xcode. Weâ€™ll walk step-by-step through the process of creating a String Catalog, translating text, and exchanging files with external translators. Youâ€™ll learn best practices for providing necessary context to translators and how Xcode can help to provide this information automatically. For larger projects, weâ€™ll also dive into techniques to manage complexity and streamline string management using type-safe Swift code.

# Get started with MLX for Apple silicon

MLX is a flexible and efficient array framework for numerical computing and machine learning on Apple silicon. Weâ€™ll explore fundamental features including unified memory, lazy computation, and function transformations. Weâ€™ll also look at more advanced techniques for building and accelerating machine learning models across Appleâ€™s platforms using Swift and Python APIs.

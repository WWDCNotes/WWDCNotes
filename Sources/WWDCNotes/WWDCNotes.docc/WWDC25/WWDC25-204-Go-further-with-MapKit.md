# Go further with MapKit

Discover the latest updates to MapKit and MapKit JS. Weâ€™ll introduce a new type of directions â€” cycling â€” and show you how to enable 3D Look Around imagery on the web.  Learn how the new Geocoding API supports conversion between coordinates and addresses, and how to use the Address Representations API to get the most appropriate address for a region. Then weâ€™ll wrap it up with a new way of referencing places that ensures your app will work seamlessly with App Intents.

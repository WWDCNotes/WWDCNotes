# Enhance child safety with PermissionKit

Discover how PermissionKit helps you enhance communication safety for children in your app. We‚Äôll show you how to use this new framework to create age-appropriate communication experiences and leverage Family Sharing for parental approvals. You‚Äôll learn how to build permission requests that seamlessly integrate with Messages, handle parental responses, and adapt your UI for child users. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúDeliver age-appropriate experiences in your app‚Äù from WWDC25.

# Filter and tunnel network traffic with NetworkExtension

Learn about the APIs in the NetworkExtension framework that give your app the power and flexibility to extend the systemâ€™s core networking features â€” like implementing network content filters, creating and managing VPN configurations, and more. In iOS, iPadOS and macOS 26, you can now build robust content filters that make traffic decisions using the entire URL â€” not just the hostname â€” all without compromising privacy and security. Weâ€™ll start by briefly covering many of the key use cases for the NetworkExtension framework, including network relays and VPN. Then, weâ€™ll dive into the new URL filter API and its key components, including Private Information Retrieval, Privacy Pass, and more.

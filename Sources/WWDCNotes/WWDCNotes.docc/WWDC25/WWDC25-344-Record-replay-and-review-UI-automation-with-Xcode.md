# Record, replay, and review: UI automation with Xcode

Learn to record, run, and maintain XCUIAutomation tests in Xcode. Replay your XCTest UI tests in dozens of locales, device types, and system conditions using test plan configurations. Review your test results using the Xcode test report, and download screenshots and videos of your runs. We‚Äôll also cover best practices for preparing your app for automation with Accessibility and writing stable, high-quality automation code.

## Key Takeaways
- ü§ñ UI automation has three key phases: record, replay and review
- ü¶Æ It is powered by Accessibility
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Can do on Xcode Cloud

## UI automation overview
Inside Xcode there are two testing frameworks: Swift Testing & XCText.

When importing XCText, XCUIAutomation is automatically included.
XCUIAutomation can interact with your app like a person does.

A complete app testing suite would be something like this:

- Unit tests test your logic and models. With Swift Testing, you can test frameworks and Swift Packages that don't even have user interface.
- UI automation tests validate your app's user experience, as well as integration with Apple harewares and the behaviors of common workflows.

### Benefits of UI automation
- User experience
- Accessibility
- Localization
- Hareware interaction
- Launch performance

There are three key phrases to setup a UI automation:
1. Record your interactions
2. Replay in multiple configurations
3. Review videos and results

> UI automation is supported on all apple platforms: iOS/iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS(Designed for iPad).

### Sum up for what UI automation can do 
- Interacts with your app like a person would
- Runs independently from your app
- Instructs the operating system what actions to perform
- Actions include launching your app, interacting with it, and setting system state

> Accessibility powers UI automation. Having a great experience of Accessibility means you will get a great UI automation experience too.

## Prepare your app for automation
> Your app can be automated with no code changes. The steps covered in this section is not required, but they can lead to better and higher quality of results.

1. Add accessibility identifiers
- Best way to identify an element in your app for automation
- Add identifiers for elements with localized strings or dynamic content
- Good identifiers are:
    - Unique
    - Descriptive
    - Static

In SwiftUI, this is done by adding a view modifier `.accessibilityIdentifier`. In UIKit, set the `accessibilityIdentifier` property of an accessibility element.
> Most UIView like Controls, Texts, and Images are accessibility elements by default.

Accessibility property exposure:
| Property                | VoiceOver | UI Automation |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| accessibilityLabel      | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| accessibilityTraits     | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| accessibilityValue      | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| accessibilityIdentifier | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

2. Review your app's accessibility
Xcode ships with an app call Accessibility Inspector, which lets you find, diagnose and fix accessibility issues.

3. Add a new UI testing target

## Record your interactions
When open the UI test source file for the first time, a popover will appear telling you how to start a UI recording.
Or you can tap the button on the side bar, then Xcode will automatically build and relaunch your app in the simulator.

Next, as you interact with your app, the code representing your interactions will be recorded in the source editor.

After recording, these steps may help you get the automation you wanted:
- Review UI queries
    - Prefer accessibility identifiers over localized string
    - Keep queries as concise as possible
    - Prefer generic queries for dynamic content

- Add validations
- Explore other automation APIs

## Replay in multiple configurations
### Test plan configuration
- Include or exclude individual tests
- Set system settings for where and how tests will run
- Manage timeouts, repetitions on failure, and execution order
- Associated with a scheme and build settings

You can use Xcode Cloud to run your UI tests.

## Review videos and results
Double click on the failure of the test report and you can check the video recorded when the test failed.

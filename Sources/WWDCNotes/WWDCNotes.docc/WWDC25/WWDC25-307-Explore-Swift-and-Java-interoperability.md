# Explore Swift and Java interoperability

Learn how you can mix Swift and Java in a single codebase. Weâ€™ll introduce the swift-java interoperability project, which allows you to use Swift in Java programs or vice versa. Weâ€™ll show you how to use the tools and libraries offered by swift-java to write safe and performant code that interoperates between these two runtimes.

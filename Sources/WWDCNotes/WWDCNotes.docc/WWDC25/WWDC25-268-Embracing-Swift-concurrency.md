# Embracing Swift concurrency

Join us to learn the core Swift concurrency concepts. Concurrency helps you improve app responsiveness and performance, and Swift is designed to make asynchronous and concurrent code easier to write correctly. Weâ€™ll cover the steps you need to take an app through from single-threaded to concurrent. Weâ€™ll also help you determine how and when to make the best use of Swift concurrency features â€“ whether itâ€™s making your code more asynchronous, moving it to the background, or sharing data across concurrent tasks.

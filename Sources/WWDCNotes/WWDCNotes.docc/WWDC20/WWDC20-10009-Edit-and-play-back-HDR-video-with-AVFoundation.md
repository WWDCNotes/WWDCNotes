# Edit and play back HDR video with AVFoundation

Find out how you can support HDR editing and playback in your macOS app, and how you can determine if a specific hardware configuration is eligible for HDR playback. We'll show you how to use AVMutableVideoComposition with the built-in compositor and easily edit HDR content, explain how you can use Core Image's built-in image filters to create your own AVMutableVideoComposition, and demonstrate how to create and use a custom compositor to enable HDR editing.

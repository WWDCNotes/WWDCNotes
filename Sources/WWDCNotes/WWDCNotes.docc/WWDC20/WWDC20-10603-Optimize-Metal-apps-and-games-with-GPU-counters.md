# Optimize Metal apps and games with GPU counters

GPU counters can help you precisely measure GPU utilization to pinpoint bottlenecks and optimize workloads for your Metal apps and games. Weâ€™ll walk you through the tools available in the Metal System Trace instrument and Metal Debugger in Xcode 12 to profile your graphics workload, and show you how to use collected data to discover underused and overworked stages of your GPU pipeline. Discover how you can act on that data to improve your app's capabilities.

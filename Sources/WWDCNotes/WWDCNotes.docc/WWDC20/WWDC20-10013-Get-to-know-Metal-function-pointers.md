# Get to know Metal function pointers

Metal is a low-level, low-overhead hardware-accelerated graphics framework and shader application programming interface for producing stunning visual effects in applications. Discover how to make your shaders written in Metal Shading Language more programmable and extensible by using function pointers. Learn how to take advantage of this new feature for dynamic flow control in Metal shaders. Discover how to use function pointers to specify custom intersection functions in your ray tracing application. We’ll explain how function pointers allow several compilations models so you can balance GPU pipeline size against runtime performance.

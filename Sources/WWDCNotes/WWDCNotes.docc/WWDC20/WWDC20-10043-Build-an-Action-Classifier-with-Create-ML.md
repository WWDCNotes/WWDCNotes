# Build an Action Classifier with Create ML

Discover how to build Action Classification models in Create ML. With a custom action classifier, your app can recognize and understand body movements in real-time from videos or through a camera. Weâ€™ll show you how to use samples to easily train a Core ML model to identify human actions like jumping jacks, squats, and dance moves. Learn how this is powered by the Body Pose estimation features of the Vision Framework. Get inspired to create apps that can provide coaching for fitness routines, deliver feedback on athletic form, and more.

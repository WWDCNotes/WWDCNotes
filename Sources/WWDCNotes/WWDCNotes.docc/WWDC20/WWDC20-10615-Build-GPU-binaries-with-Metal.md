# Build GPU binaries with Metal

Power up your shader pipeline with enhancements to the Metal shader compilation model — all leading to a dramatic reduction in Pipeline State Object (PSO) loading time, especially upon first launch. Learn about explicit PSO caching and sharing of GPU binaries using Metal binary archives and dynamic libraries. And we’ll detail the toolchain to create libraries and improve your shader compilation workflow.

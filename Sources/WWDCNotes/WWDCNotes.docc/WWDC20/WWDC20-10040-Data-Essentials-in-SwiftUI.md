# Data Essentials in SwiftUI

Data is a complex part of any app, but SwiftUI makes it easy to ensure a smooth, data-driven experience from prototyping to production. Discover @State and @Binding, two powerful tools that can preserve and seamlessly update your Source of Truth. We'll also show you how ObservableObject lets you connect your views to your data model. Learn about some tricky challenges and cool new ways to solve them — directly from the experts!

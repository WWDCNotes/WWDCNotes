# Harness Apple GPUs with Metal

Create visually stunning, high-performance apps and games when you combine the power of Apple GPUs with Metal, the modern foundation for GPU-accelerated graphics on Apple platforms. Discover the architecture and capabilities of the Apple GPU and how Metal harnesses its tile-based deferred rendering (TBDR) architecture to achieve measurable performance gains in apps and games. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss the efficiency of Apple GPUs and show how TBDR applies to an array of modern rendering techniques.

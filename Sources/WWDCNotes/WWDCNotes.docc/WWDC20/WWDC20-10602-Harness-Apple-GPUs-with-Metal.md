# Harness Apple GPUs with Metal

Create visually stunning, high-performance apps and games when you combine the power of Apple GPUs with Metal, the modern foundation for GPU-accelerated graphics on Apple platforms. Discover the architecture and capabilities of the Apple GPU and how Metal harnesses its tile-based deferred rendering (TBDR) architecture to achieve measurable performance gains in apps and games. In this session, we’ll discuss the efficiency of Apple GPUs and show how TBDR applies to an array of modern rendering techniques.

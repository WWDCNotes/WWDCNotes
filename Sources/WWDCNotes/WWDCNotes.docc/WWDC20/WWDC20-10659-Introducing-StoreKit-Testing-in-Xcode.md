# Introducing StoreKit Testing in Xcode

Discover StoreKit Testing in Xcode — a local environment for testing your in-app purchases without needing to connect to App Store servers. We’ll show you how to set up a test environment, create a StoreKit configuration file, and prepare to validate receipts locally. We’ll also explain how to test a variety of in-app purchase scenarios and automate those tests with the StoreKitTest framework, and cover the latest improvements to testing in the sandbox environment.

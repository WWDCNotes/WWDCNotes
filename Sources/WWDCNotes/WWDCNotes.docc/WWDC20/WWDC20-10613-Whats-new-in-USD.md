# What's new in USD

Discover proposed schema and structure updates to the Universal Scene Description (USD) standard. Learn how you can use Reality Composer to build AR content with interactive properties like anchoring, physics, behaviors, 3D text, and spatial audio that exports to USDZ. And, discover streamlined workflows that help you bring newly-created objects into your app.

If you're interested to learn more about USDZ as a distribution format, check out "Working with USD.” And for more on creating AR content with Reality Composer, watch “The Artist's AR Toolkit."

We’d love to hear feedback about the preliminary schemas. After you watch this session, come join us on the Developer Forums and share your thoughts.

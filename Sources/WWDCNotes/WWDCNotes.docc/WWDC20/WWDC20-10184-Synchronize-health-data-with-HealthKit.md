# Synchronize health data with HealthKit

HealthKit provides you the tools to smartly manage health data anywhere, whether across multiple HealthKit-enabled devices such as iPhone and Apple Watch or with an external server to share data across a care team. In this session, weâ€™ll dive into managing data versions via HealthKit's built-in sync identifier metadata, how to detect changes in health data using an HKAnchoredObjectQuery, and cover best practices for ensuring you're always working with the right data everywhere.

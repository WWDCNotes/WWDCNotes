# Adopt the new look of macOS

Make over your Mac apps: Discover how you can embrace the new design of macOS Big Sur and adopt its visual hierarchy, design patterns, and behaviors. We’ll explore the latest updates to AppKit around structural items and common controls, and show you how you can adapt more customized interfaces with just a bit of adoption work. And find out how you can incorporate custom accent colors and symbols to further personalize your app.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with AppKit and SF Symbols. For additional information on symbols, watch "SF Symbols 2.0”.

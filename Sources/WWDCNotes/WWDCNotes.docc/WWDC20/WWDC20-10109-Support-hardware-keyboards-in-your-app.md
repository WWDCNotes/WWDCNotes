# Support hardware keyboards in your app

When people use hardware keyboards with your app, theyâ€™re not only getting a more tactile and familiar typing experience â€” they can quickly navigate or use keyboard shortcuts, too.

Learn how easy it is to get up and running with common system keyboard shortcuts, use modifier flags with gesture recognizers, and leverage the raw keyboard event API to respond to key down and key up events.

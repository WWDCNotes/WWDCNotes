# Handle trackpad and mouse input

Provide a more versatile experience when you optimize your iPad or Mac Catalyst app for indirect input from trackpads and mice. Discover how to make your app responsive to new events from these devices. Learn how to work with pointer movement, enable pointer locking, handle scroll input and trackpad gestures, and accept or reject events on your gesture recognizers. We’ll also show you how to implement advanced features like changing gesture behaviors with keyboard modifiers or pointing device buttons to delight pro users and bring a richer experience to your app.

To learn more about pointer-based interactions and to get the most out of this session, we recommend watching “Build for the iPadOS pointer,” “Bring keyboard and mouse gaming to iPad,” and “Support hardware keyboards in your app.”
